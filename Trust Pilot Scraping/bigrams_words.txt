1. It has been more than 8 days, and I still haven't received my money, despite emailing and messaging for support. All EzyRemit does is tell me to wait. I will never use this company's services again. Don't trust their advertisements; be careful—they might be a scam. They are waiting for the exchange rate to rise before transferring your money.
2. Worst service. Holding my money for 7 days and the recipient still has not received the money. I will never use their service again. My friends and my family have the same problem.
3. I am disguted to see 4 star ratings here.It makes me wonder Trust Pilot is trust worthy?Does it help people with up to date information?Ezyremit takes your money and keeps it forever.My current situation as at 23.12.2024, I bank transfer  money from Australia to Viet Nam on 11.12.2024. Ezyremit confirms payment few hours later.Until today, 23.12.2024, the money is still not delivered.Ezyremit website promises 12-24 h on bank transfer.Decide for yourself.Stay away from this company.
4. I had a disappointing experience with this company. They requested an excessive amount of unnecessary documents, which made the entire process time-consuming and frustrating. Despite their assurance that funds would be delivered overseas within 12-24 hours, the process was extremely slow and far from efficient. I ultimately decided to end our business relationship due to the lack of transparency and poor service. I would not recommend them if you value prompt and straightforward service.
5. Extremely slow, paid by instant payid 24 hours ago but they cannot confirm they have received the money. Very poor and rudimentary system. After uploading IDs, no confirmation either. Avoid for peace of mind. All other places like western union, remitly etc did the transfer in 2 secs.
6. People should be cautious of 4 or 5 star reviews here.I have used Ezyremit to send money to VN over the years, due to their exchange rates and fees are always slightly better than Hải Hà, Châu Hoàng or Western Union.However,  for bank transfer it takes 3 days to one week for delivery, not 24 hours as incorrectly advertised.Even longer for cash pick-up, not 72 hours as advertised.I believe the Vietnamese end prefers holding on to your money as long as they can.For Haiha, Châu Hoàng,  Western Union, it is same day delivery if the recipient lives from Saigon to Nha Trang. They can deliver to further cities on the next day.In summary,  use Ezyremit if you have one week to 2 weeks to receive the money in Việt Nam. This is the fact.
7. We tried sending money, and also receiving money, but each it took over 2 weeks to get notifications and several days later to finalized.  We tried contacting many times, and was told that it's in processing.  They should change the name from EzRemit to NOT EzRemit!   Terrible company, terrible service.
8. Took four days for delivery. I transferred by payID. Called three times, was told it be delivered soon...each time. Not a happy customer.
