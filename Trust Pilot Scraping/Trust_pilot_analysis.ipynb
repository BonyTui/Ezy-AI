      "1. It has been more than 8 days, and I still haven't received my money, despite emailing and messaging for support. All EzyRemit does is tell me to wait. I will never use this company's services again. Don't trust their advertisements; be careful—they might be a scam. They are waiting for the exchange rate to rise before transferring your money.\n",
      "2. Worst service. Holding my money for 7 days and the recipient still has not received the money. I will never use their service again. My friends and my family have the same problem.\n",
      "3. I am disguted to see 4 star ratings here.It makes me wonder Trust Pilot is trust worthy?Does it help people with up to date information?Ezyremit takes your money and keeps it forever.My current situation as at 23.12.2024, I bank transfer  money from Australia to Viet Nam on 11.12.2024. Ezyremit confirms payment few hours later.Until today, 23.12.2024, the money is still not delivered.Ezyremit website promises 12-24 h on bank transfer.Decide for yourself.Stay away from this company.\n",
      "4. I had a disappointing experience with this company. They requested an excessive amount of unnecessary documents, which made the entire process time-consuming and frustrating. Despite their assurance that funds would be delivered overseas within 12-24 hours, the process was extremely slow and far from efficient. I ultimately decided to end our business relationship due to the lack of transparency and poor service. I would not recommend them if you value prompt and straightforward service.\n",
      "5. Extremely slow, paid by instant payid 24 hours ago but they cannot confirm they have received the money. Very poor and rudimentary system. After uploading IDs, no confirmation either. Avoid for peace of mind. All other places like western union, remitly etc did the transfer in 2 secs.\n",
      "6. People should be cautious of 4 or 5 star reviews here.I have used Ezyremit to send money to VN over the years, due to their exchange rates and fees are always slightly better than Hải Hà, Châu Hoàng or Western Union.However,  for bank transfer it takes 3 days to one week for delivery, not 24 hours as incorrectly advertised.Even longer for cash pick-up, not 72 hours as advertised.I believe the Vietnamese end prefers holding on to your money as long as they can.For Haiha, Châu Hoàng,  Western Union, it is same day delivery if the recipient lives from Saigon to Nha Trang. They can deliver to further cities on the next day.In summary,  use Ezyremit if you have one week to 2 weeks to receive the money in Việt Nam. This is the fact.\n",
      "7. We tried sending money, and also receiving money, but each it took over 2 weeks to get notifications and several days later to finalized.  We tried contacting many times, and was told that it's in processing.  They should change the name from EzRemit to NOT EzRemit!   Terrible company, terrible service.\n",
      "8. Took four days for delivery. I transferred by payID. Called three times, was told it be delivered soon...each time. Not a happy customer.\n",

      "1. They plainly refused to give me the money somebody sent me. I have the reference number, all the names, and the ID, yet they just refuse. The customer support is not responding to my letters.\n",
      "2. AWFUL! They charged the money, but could not deliver. They do not communicate with each other and have kept my money hanging for days, and still do to this day. They cannot solve the problem, yet they ask me to wait 10 business days for the refund, and refuse to refund immediately, because of an issue which is obviously on their side!\n",
      "3. I transferred money dozens of times with MoneyGram, but suddenly it didn't work anymore. -Incorrect Password. - After hours of searching, I couldn't fix it.  Then just sent an E-Mail to MoneyGram, which, after waiting for days, was followed by an Mail that people just blocked me from using MoneyGram.  I had never had any problems until that day I couldn't get into my account anymore.  Why couldn't they send me an Mail that I would be excluded?  I lost a lot of time trying to solve the missed password.  It is very customer-friendly to act like this.  I will therefore not recommend anyone to use MoneyGram.\n",
      "4. I sent money in 2021 to someone in europe. It never arrived  last week July14 2025 money gram sent me a letter giving me the opportunity to retreve my $1000, before they handed it over to the state of Calif. I have now sent numerous times emails and made phone calls containing all the documentation they require for a refund.  So far nothing. no message, no call, no money. i also went to the office  money gram, twice  on state street in santa barbara ca where i first started this messy transaction, and was told I needed a code to be refunded. Starting to look like a giant scam to me. Spoke with several \"agents\" in India who had accents so thick and background noise so loud almost impossible to understand.. and no help whatsoever. (the ultimate outsourcing nightmare, (poor devils are probable being paid 50 cents an hour washing moneygram's  dirty laundry) If you want  a whole lot of grief and wasted hours keep using moneygram. There are many other way to safely send money abroad. What a crap company.. Obviously never ever again\n",
      "5. Worse ever. Never use it.They dont send your money, instead just holding it for as long as possible.In my case, its already more then 20 days and they will hold it even longer.Never use moneygramm.\n",
      "6. 🚨 Public Complaint to MoneyGramMore than 14 days ago, I filed a complaint for a refund through @MoneyGram, and it hasn't been returned. I opened a case, they made me wait 14 days, and then they closed it without a solution.Today I called again and they told me completely different things:• That the number didn't exist, then it did.• That the money was delivered, but they keep asking for my account to return it.• That they closed the previous case, but they opened a new one with an additional 14 days.Is this a serious company? Where is my money? How long are they going to make me wait without resolving anything?I demand an immediate solution or I will go to the consumer protection agency and other legal bodies.#MoneyGram #Complaint #Fraud #NoMoreAbuse #ConsumerProtection\n",
      "7. Moneygram was terrible. I was never even successful at sending money to my friend in India. I know there are scams based in India, but this is a long-time friend who I know personally.  Their country is a nightmare, so I like to send them a gift or help with medical issues once in a while, and Moneygram flagged my transaction ($500) and shut down my profile.  I called their service number, the girl who answered was very hard to understand, said I was shut down and that I could do nothing to reopen.  I asked for her supervisor.  Same story--hard to understand and confirmed that I am down permanently. Super obnoxious.  So, now I use Ria.  Much easier, user-friendly, happy to never use Moneygram.\n",
      "8. I sent money to a Bank in Thailand with regards to a Hotel payment and had no previous issues. This time I sent a payment to the same account and received a receipt to confirm the payment had been made. When I checked 5 days later it still had not been sent. I phoned Moneygram and they said they had blocked payment since they were concerned about fraud. I received no communication that the payment was blocked. Consequently with the delay I lost my room at the Hotel. Why was I not informed? Why the block when this would have been the third payment to the same recipient. When I complained I was put through to someone with poor English skills who was simply unable to grasp or understand my experience. Would not recommend.See below the “copy and paste” response. Noticeable how lots of reviews on here have had the very same experience. They should be put out of business.\n",
      "9. My partner transferred money to my account in the Philippines from Australia to use as our vacation money. We are both from Australia, I also have a Moneygram account and used the transfer service before. They marked my partner's transfer as high chances of fraud, without informing him. We were both waiting for the transfer for weeks and sending them emails. Had to call their customer service number that cost us $100 to call from Philippines. We wouldn't have found out if we didn't call them. Never had this issue with other money transfer services. Never using again.I don't know why they would immediately tag something as \"fraud\" just based on the country. They could've looked up my name and found that I've also used moneygram before. They didn't even inform my partner about this. We were waiting for the money as we needed it for our vacation. Very inconvenient.\n",
      "10. I sent money to Kinshasa - Congo every month to the same person an elderly relative for his upkeep. The person is near 80 years old he would walk to go and collect the funds only to find out something is wrong and he can’t collect the money. Proper identification and reference code was given yet money gram people in Kinshasa will put in a code stating something was wrong with the person’s ID or something. The problem is money gram have no control over their personnel internationally.The Standard Operating Procedure is not strictly followed and when customer service is called their justification is nonsensical. The customer service don’t check back in their data base to see if you have been sending money to the same person etc. They collect information but they can’t give any justification why they want the information. While my ordinary telephone company could collect the data, justify, verify and make a judgement with one customer service agent on the same day not several days later after using multiple departments.This is coming from someone who has been with Money gram for the past 25 years. I have reached my last straw with them. Their international section needs more training and to stop trying to intimidate customers for a portion of their money.\n",
      "11. Can I give 0 stars please? Godawful service. It's been nearly two days since I transferred myself money through moneygram that I was supposed to receive in my mobile wallet but still haven't received the amount worth $300 despite it being deducted. Complaints and asking for more information gets me nothing…Moneygram is a good advertisement for Western Union..\n",
      "12. Online account deactivated saying that my account could not be verified. Never received any email to ask me to verify my account. Got permanently banned without any reason. No solution from their representative, now I have to go to store everytime without even the start of an explanation.Good Job moneygram !\n",
      "13. I’m in Edinburgh Scotland, the whole day Friday I cannot find one single location to pick up my money , this is very bad ! Google shows lots of locations, but any location you pop in , they all say they don’t do it anymore ! Can MoneyGram please pin me one location in Edinburgh?\n",
      "14. Worst money transfer company ever, they’ll tell you straight up to find some other company to send your money with, I was so surprised hearing the agent on the phone say that, they do not want our business, it is highly unprofessional, just throw the company away at this point..\n",
      "15. The worst experience I’ve had with MoneyGram!I spent the entire morning going to over 10 different shops, and none of them had money available for pickup. It used to be reliable, especially when it was available at the Post Office, but since they ended that partnership, it’s been a complete disaster. Absolutely frustrating and unacceptable. I strongly recommend not using this service to send money anymore!\n",
      "16. Why you do not allow changing the country and why charge if we cancel.\n",
      "17. Was told by a friend this app was good to use to send money internationally so signed up yesterday and gave the relevant evidence to prove I said who I was so documents, passport, and photo checks after all that I tried multiple times to send money and was declined and eventually blocked out of my account if I'm honest they are shit and wont be using them again after the way I've been treated,Stupid response from moneygram when my experience was rubbish which is why I wont be returning to the useless app that has no respect for their customers.\n",
      "18. The sender provided all the required details on me.  The app told me the money was available to collect.  I walked a long distance to a place I could collect it... to find out it wasn't available to collect.  We will not be using them again.\n",
      "19. I went to MoneyGram to send money to Jamaica I've had no issue sending it through Western Union today I went there they went to the MoneyGram place twice in Jamaica they were refused and then when I went back to cancel it to go to Western Union to send it they wouldn't give me my processing feedback so yeah they get a one rating from me what a rip off and they charge a lot more than Western Union for their fees so you will lose my business MoneyGram and have a wonderful life\n",
      "20. They close my account with any reason very bad service\n",
      "21. Never ever use Money Gram, locations on Google maps are inaccurate, closed or don't exist anymore, Money Gram pretend that UK Post Office deliver the transfers but it is not true, worst service ever, uso other options when you want to transfer money, worst, worst and took me one day to travel in other town to get my money, in Newark on Trent UK, there is no money gram, this service should be shut down or maybe a good CEO can fix the situation, in the mean time, DONT USE MONEY GRAM\n",
      "22. Buenos dias, yo le pido a MoneyGram de responder a los correos electronicos que yo les he enviado, para una verificacion me han pedido mis documentos con mi direccion y la direccion del beneficiario , yo lo he enviado y aun no tengo la respuesta.Bonjour, je demande à MoneyGram de répondre aux e-mails que je leur ai envoyés. Ils ont demandé mes documents avec mon adresse et celle du destinataire pour vérification. Je les ai envoyés et je n'ai toujours pas reçu de réponse.Good morning, I ask MoneyGram to respond to the emails I've sent them. They've asked for my documents with my address and the recipient's address for verification. I've sent them and still haven't received a response.\n",
      "23. MoneyGram IS RISKING LIVESFunds meant to arrive in minutes have been “in transit” for 72 hours with no way to cancel, amend, or retrieve them , while my loved one desperately waits in crisis.This isn’t just bad service. It’s DANGEROUS AND UNFAIR TO THE PEACE OF MIND OF HARD WORKING CLASS PEOPLE .Do NOT trust them with emergency transfers!!!!\n",
      "24. I have been a routine customer of MoneyGram International for the past +3 years, sending money routinely to my girlfriend in the Philippines using MoneyGram's mobile app. Out of the blue on 5/27/25, my attempted money transfer of $300 was held up pending more information needed to be provided. So, I contacted MoneyGram by phone and spoke with a customer service rep. The rep informed me that they would need to ask me additional questions about my transaction before they could allow it to be sent. I was totally okay answering questions, as I had nothing to hide. I was asked many questions about how long I'd known my girlfriend, how we met, how often we communicate, when did we meet, and what was the reason I was sending \"my\" money, amongst a few other rather personal questions. I felt like I was being interrogated by the FBI or something. But fine, I understand the world in which we live and how bad online scams are. Afterall, I spent many years investigating these very types of crimes. So, I gave the company the benefit of the doubt that they were just doing what they needed to do, to make sure neither I nor my girlfriend were scammers. Long story short, I answered all of the questions honestly and had no concerns because I knew I was not engaging in anything unlawful. MoneyGram canceled my attempted transfer and fully refunded my money 24 hours later (thankfully). I attempted to log back into my account today so that I could try again, only to find out that they closed my online account, and gave me zero reasoning why until I called in to find out why I could no longer access my online account. I was told that they \"were not comfortable with my activity, and that they could not verify my identity online\". I'm not sure why they couldn't verify my identity, as they certainly had my identification information from my account. But anyways, they just lost a 100% legitimate routine customer for over +3 years, because I somehow made them feel uncomfortable because I was using their online service to send money overseas to my girlfriend. The same person I have been routinely sending money to for +3 years without any issues, and no complaints. Just amazing MoneyGram. Job not well done. I'm guessing that the scammers get better service now than your once otherwise regular law abiding customers do. Smdh. Will gladly seek out your top competitors to continue doing my routine \"legal\" business, while you continue serving or servicing your scammers. Thankfully there are alternatives for the services you offer, and hopefully you will soon go the way of the dinosaurs, with your new found ridiculous hyper suspiciousness. And for the record, the first search I conducted after writing this review, was to find out who your top competitors are. Here I come Wise and Remitly, you can thank MoneyGram for sending me your way.\n",
      "25. Moneygram have scammers within them and they are protecting them. I have been a victim of scam four times. Don't use them for your good\n",
      "26. Do not use MoneyGram & this will be the last time for me, my mom or father!Oh dear! I was told by my father not to use MoneyGram because of the issues he experienced, and I did not listen.Story time:Receiver unable to collect money sent on 25th March 2025, on 3 separate occasions, 3 days in a row, because their system was down.I had to resent money again via Western Union, to pay for an urgent business transaction.Now MoneyGram has informed me over the phone, I cannot have the sending fee of £4.99 refunded.So far today 2 months later they have not yet returned the money back to my account, whilst requesting I cancel the transaction in the app and lose £4.99 for their c0ck up and annoying inconvenient to me.Just return my money so I can DELETE YOUR APP instantly and NEVER use you company again.\n",
      "27. i hates money gram because the block me reason it that I send too much money and is suspicious  .Anytime I send money i have to call money gram again to confirm is me who send. I even lost my mom because of that call .  money comes late , in africa before doctor examined you and give you the  prescription you must to pay first so I send money my brother go pick up the money they tell him to call me to confirm again it me ,the time he was calling me because of  difference time I was sleeping i didn't hear my phone ,7 hours later I saw 8 missed call my mom died ready by pain for lack of medicine they time to go borrow to a friend it was ready let for her to survive the pain.I hates you soo bad money gram  I hope you will paid one day with your stupid services.  Why to confirm again when you ready had a code, and your agents always cutting money 30$ when you already paid the fee the suspicious payment is YOU!!!! from 1000$ my brother get 970$ your agent cut 30$ from MY MONEY when I already paid my fee and for what are you sorry you loose nothing  you make me even more angry now\n",
      "28. Don’t use this company😡😡😡😡Bad service\n",
      "29. Avoid using MoneyGram. It is one of the most unreliable remittance companies I have ever encountered. I sent three transactions, but none of them were paid out. You cannot amend or even cancel a transaction once your money is sent; you are left at their mercy. Your money gets stuck, they don’t get paid, and the recipient does not receive the funds. You'll end up having to send the money through another company.This is my third time experiencing this frustration, and it will be my last. BE WARNED: STAY AWAY FROM MONEYGRAM. I am switching to Afro International.\n",
      "30. The system keeps blocking my account everytime I make a transaction and I have to reach out to customer care to sort it. Very unimpressed\n",
      "31. I tried sending my friend a sum of couple thousand euros to United States. They were not able to withdraw the cash at any Moneygram location because nobody held cash balance more than couple of thousand dollars and they had limits of $1000 per transaction. Walmart would have supposedly have enough cash to cover the transaction but did not serve foreigners. Moneygram didn't refund the fee even though they didn't perform any service at all. Also their list of partners on their website does not reflect reality at all.\n",
      "32. Bad customer service. Don't understand why since it's a money transfer service place but can't solve issues. Issues such as doesn't know what happen and can't see why customer couldn't send money. I wanna know what kind of customer service this is.\n",
      "33. Don't use it! My experience the first two times I used it was terrible. During a family emergency, my family couldn’t access the funds—it was sent back to me. They wouldn’t allow me to process a refund for my mother, who was recently hospitalized and unable to go into the store. The money was not in my account, my mother’s, or with our family. I’m very disappointed that Money Mart stopped using Western Union for MoneyGram.\n",
      "34. 2nd transaction already within 4 month that gets stuck.Once a transactions gets stuck in transition MoneyGram will do NOTHING until the expected delivery date has passed. Then you yourself will have to complain to open a case. Then up to 15 days can pass until they clarify and issue a refund which can take another long many days.Customer service gives only generic playbook answer pointing to their policies. Zero help, despite urgency in payments nothing is done. You basically have to wait and hope. I have never experiences a financial institution that care this little.My case ID is 38817731\n",
      "35. The app needs to learn how to design a system from Remitly.\n",
      "36. These guys tried to scam me. They held my money for 3 days and then had the audacity to tell me that their partner confirmed that \"my money transfer has been sent successfully to Receiver's account provided in Send Form and refund is not possible\" which was a big lie.When I told them that I was going to escalate the issue to Ombudsman,they released my money. Don't let them scam you!\n",
      "37. Don't use this service (service is a misnomer)They do not release the funds without the recipient jumping through hoops and having to contact the sender to verify that the money was sent and to whom.It took 2 hours for my daughter to access the funds I sent to her as an anniversary gift.I had to revisit the selling agent, who had to call Moneygram directly while I was waiting, and they required personal verification from me that I had sent the money to my daughter.  What's the point of using a system that holds your funds in ransom. It is supposed to be a fast seamless transaction - far from it.\n",
      "38. I wrote a review about 10 days ago and gave zero stars for the poor service I received.Then someone called me claiming to be from Moneygram. He wanted me to write a good review and give 5 stars. He offered to correct the problem with Money transfer immediately. But he was not able to even though I spent hours with him. It was a waste of my time.Then he offered to deposit 300 dollars into my bank account and refund me an additional 105 dollars because the money transfer to Morocco was messed up, a total of 405 dollars.He told me this money will be in my checking account on April 28, 2025.  It did not happen. When I called their number, I received a message that the number was disconnected.  LOOKED VERY SHADY.Then I received a call on April 29, 2025 from someone claiming to be Moneygram. He wanted my bank details and credit card details to transfer the 405 dollar compensation.I did not give him anything and disconnected the phone.Bottom line, if these were indeed Moneygram folks trying to compensate me then they were extremely incompetent because I spent a long time on the phone and the result was zero.On the other hand if they were scam artists, then Moneygram should look into it.\n",
      "39. I tried to send money with MoneyGram to Afghanistan one month ago.  The money was never sent, nor has it been refunded.  Every time I call MoneyGram they give different reasons for the lost money.  But so far they have never accepted responsibility or refunded my money.  I am not going to let this go.\n",
      "40. These guys are scammer.  Hold your money for 10 days. Nd cancel your transfer\n",
      "41. As a vendor I had recommended Money Gram. Never again. They stalled payment. Then claimed a technical issue then stopped payment.\n",
      "42. The worst experience ever. I sent money from turkey to morroco on an emergency situation, moneygram agency informed me it would be instant. Few minutes later their website transaction tracking was showing the money ready for pick up, great! But when the other part went to pick up the money, they start to say the money didn't arrive. After ask them why the website show it is ready to pick up if the money is not there, they said its because of the \"algorithm\" and it shows that is instant but the money its not actually there. A BIG SCAM dont trust this company, now i dont know where my money is, and for sure they will charge me to cancel the transaction, even though the money never arrived. I would give -5 stars if i could. Be aware that you can have this sort of problem and go for more reliable options if you need to send money abroad\n",
      "43. BE CAREFUL, IT'S A  FRAUD-GRAM NOT MONEY-GRAM.I SENT MONEY FROM USA TO OVERSEAS,THE RECEIVER WENT TOO MANY AGENCIES,THEY SAID NOTHING COME WITH THE RECIPIENT IS NAME & THAT THE MONEY STILL IN USA.I CONTACT THEM THEY KEEP SAYING IT HAS BEEN PICKED UP. NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ASK YOU ON MONEYGRAM BE CAREFUL FROM FRAUD,IT LIKE THEY SAID IF IT WILL HAPPEN,NOT FROM US ITS FROM THE COUNTRY YOU SENT TOO. THE AGENCIES IN MY COUNTRY SAID IT HAPPENEDTO TOOOOOO MANY CUSTOMERS. I HAVE A SUGGESTION BEFORE TO TRANSFER FROM DIFFERENT COMPANY I REFUSED BUT NOW I'M DONE MY FAMILY& RELATIVES.\n",
      "44. Unbelievable! I created my account in the app, followed all their instructions, sent my identification, everything. I was then believable enough to depositing money into my account but when I went to send it, I couldn't be verified that it was me sending the money. It took 3 days to unlock my account and to be told to see a representative in person. I did that, but at the bank they wanted a transaction reference number. Failed transactions do not create a reference number. The representative at the bank told me to run the transaction again. I did, it failed again and with no number. They then said there was nothing they could do to help me. I wouldn't use this worthless company if they were the only company that transferred money. Oh! And to top it off, two weeks to get a paper check to get my money back. Did I tell you how worthless Moneygram is? Save yourself the anguish and use anyone else.\n",
      "45. I had a good experience but I give them 3 starts because of the long queue and minimal amount of counters.\n",
      "46. Moneygram in Ireland seems very badly managed.We tried four different centers over three days, just to send €100 to a Central American country.The first place - Aungier st., Dublin 2- insisted on cash.The second place was not open until Thursday- and it has a phone number that isn’t answered. (Navan- seems very dodgy.)The third place- LowerO’Connell street- no longer operating.The last place ( ILAC Centre) very rude and claimed we had only paid them €100, but we are sure we handed over€120 in cash. Their phone number goes unanswered.Who is regulating these people?\n",
      "47. we had a very bad experience ,my sister had to go to 5 different places before she got her money, The first place was super rude and sent her away 2 times. She had to drive to another town to get her money. I had to explain to the customer service what the money was used for ,relationship to person who would get the money and why I sent it. The second time I had a very good customer service experience with a phone call-the only reason I gave 3 stars .Bad exchange rate .To get her money it took 3 days .The response is generic, no excuse , no explanation ,meaning less to me and my sister .\n",
      "48. took my money, then asked for a proof of address but despite endless attempts to upload through there own link, I constantly got a delivery failure. So, now my money is stuckobviously, no possibility to contact by phonewhat a disaster service\n",
      "49. It feels like this company is a pyramid scheme which is on the brink of collapse. I tried to send money via them from USA to Mexico and both times the money did not go through. I had to contact their customer support to return my money.\n",
      "50. I used Moneygram for a long time. All of a sudden they changed procedure and you had to go though \"Trustly\". From This moment it happened several times, that they deducted the money from my account but reported, that the transfer was not possible. All of a sudden they informed me, that they could not do transfers anymore, because I resided in a Central American country, but had a German account. I deleted my account but still get mails from them\n",
      "51. MoneyGram does not allow you to transfer the full amount because they charge fees for each transaction, and their exchange rates are significantly different from online rates.\"\n",
      "52. I had a very disappointing experience with MoneyGram. I made a cash pickup transaction and shared the details with my father, the intended receiver. He went to the bank to collect the money, but the cashier was unable to process the cash out and couldn’t provide a clear reason why. Shortly after, the transaction was automatically cancelled without any explanation.When I contacted MoneyGram for help, their customer support was unhelpful and vague. I was told the transaction was cancelled because the receiver was “deemed unusual,” which makes no sense. I’ve been sending money to my father for over 15 years without a single issue using other services. This was my first time using MoneyGram and definitely the last.I even asked if they could simply change the receiver’s name so that someone else in my family could collect the funds, but they refused. Now I have to wait 10 business days to get my money back, while my family, who needed the funds urgently, is left waiting.People send money for important reasons, often to support loved ones in need. It’s incredibly frustrating when companies like MoneyGram treat such situations with carelessness. I strongly advise others to avoid using MoneyGram and choose a more reliable service.\n",
      "53. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Needed some help with logging in, and my wife was nearby to help with the technical issues. The customer service heard said wife, and said I had to turn off speaker and that no one else could be in the background helping. LIKE WTF?!?! Am I 17 taking some SAT test through the phone? WTF kind of customer service system is this? MoneyGram fix this so your customer service is more informed, I felt like I was losing brain cells by the minute!\n",
      "54. Worst customer service ever and terrible system that withholds your money unprovokedly.Why on earth would the deaf customer service robot ask you to say \"status\" multiple times and THEN ask you to press 1 on the keypad? WHO THOUGHT OF THIS? And I dont care about your stupid survey I just want my money back. Thieves.\n",
      "55. Their service level just keeps getting worse and worse. I used them for the first time about 10 years ago. They were great. But for the past couple of years, I sent 3-4 transactions and it seems that there is always a problem. Their agents on the receiving end always try illusive tricks (e.g., They don't have dollars and they want to convert the money to local currency Or They don't receive, they only send money, etc.)Their customer service is so bad. I used to call them if I had an issue, now it is almost impossible to talk to a human. It is a bad robot that keeps repeating scripted answers which is time wasting and frustrating. I don't think I will be using their services ever again.\n",
      "56. Pointless, I run a Travel I ned to pay a local transfers. as there are not outlets I created an account online, set up the payment with all the securty that goes with it. I then get a message to say they are doing there checks and will email me the result. That for one is ridiculous anyway, email came and it got rejected. Seriously, just dose not make sence to me. Cant be asked as all the shops near me are either no longer there or there machine is not working. I will now go back to WESTERN UNION (who are everywhere), they quoted me the same total cost anyway.\n",
      "57. They charged fees for a service that they did not provide me. Loss of time of more than 2 hours, plus trips to the different agencies to collect the money, but no agency provides it. After contacting customer service and wasting more than an hour on the phone, they forced me to cancel the shipment but stole the service fee, even after they were the ones who told me to cancel. Poor service and waste of time. Not recommended\n",
      "58. Do not use MoneyGram! The process is extremely confusing, and my MoneyGram was sent to the wrong receiver and for six months they have strung me along saying they would fix it. They would fix it and now they basically told me to go F myself that they can’t do anything about it. As well, take your money and flush it down the toilet.\n",
      "59. Absolutely Disgusting!!!! DO NOT DARE!!!!Dont waste your time with this company!!! Ive used the for a couple of years and since the data breach they had in the UK, their services has gone DOWNHILL.Me and my family are in a different country now and they have blocked  my money to be collected, their agent both PHYSICALLY AND ON THE PHONE, dont have a straight answer for me why they blocked the transaction. Its the most frustrating experience ever. THERES PLENTY OF COMPANIES OUT THERE. DONT BOTHER WITH MONEYGRAM!!!!\n",
      "60. Review Title: Bad Experience with MoneyGram – Delay and Non-Refund of Transfer FeesDetails:I sent £330 to Saudi Arabia via MoneyGram on February 21, along with an additional transfer fee of £4.99. Unfortunately, when the recipient went to collect the amount in the city of Sabya, none of the banks could process the transfer. He went to the National Commercial Bank, Al-Rajhi Bank, Arab Bank, and several other banks I don’t remember the names of, but all of them refused to give him the amount. Each bank asked him to go to the city of Jizan or another city to collect it, which put him in a difficult position.What was frustrating is that some banks told him that if the transfer had been sent via Western Union, they would have given him the money immediately, but because it was a MoneyGram transfer, they couldn’t process it! I had used MoneyGram in the past to send transfers to Yemen and had no problems with either the transfer or receiving the funds; on the contrary, the service was good. I even wrote a positive review about my previous experience. But unfortunately, this new issue has upset me greatly, and I didn’t expect such poor service from MoneyGram.When I contacted customer service, they confirmed that the recipient couldn’t collect the amount from his location and offered no solution except to cancel the transfer and refund the amount. But the bigger issue is that MoneyGram refused to refund the transfer fee (£4.99), even though the mistake was on their part, as they didn’t clearly specify the branch locations where the transfer could be collected before completing the transaction.Additionally, it will take 10 days to get the amount refunded to my account, which is a long and unjustified time. As if that wasn’t enough, I had to take an advance in order to send the amount to the person I had transferred it to, making the situation even more difficult. This has been a completely unsatisfactory experience, and I urge users to thoroughly check whether the transfer can be collected before using MoneyGram, as they may find themselves in a similar situation with no proper compensation, even if the mistake was on the company’s side.\n",
      "61. Be aware. I have made tens of transaction successfully but in 2020 I have send a transaction on line and the transaction was not successful but they deducted 975$ from my account. I tried tens of time to contact them with no response. I filed a court claim and the court order them to pay me the amount plus other fees, and again they refused the court order. NowI will have to apply for a court garnishment to take my money from the Canadian banks. The transaction # 96836590\n",
      "62. In August last year I used the money gram mobile app to sent 143.00 and 350 Canadian dollars respectively to my aunt and brother to facilitate the funeral arrangement of my cousin who have passed.  Both transactions were canceled for unknown reasons. I reached out to them by phone and email immediately.  They promised that a refund would be sent to my local bank in ten business days. Despite the promised to remit my money in 10 business days, I have not been able to get back my money. I have written several emails and phone calls but yet, they have failed to refund me. The transaction numbers are 80067756 and 51989948.\n",
      "63. Absolute theives.The receiver did not receive the moeny I sent through money gram, I did a complaint and even provided evidence of the person's wallet and that they did not receive the money. Money gram said my complaint was upheld but ghosted me after.WIll definitely take this further due to the psychological distress. I would adivse not wasting your time and use RIA or Western union instead. Atleast they do not theive your money.\n",
      "64. I was thinking that it could be the best service but when the are worried about to some people end other not it doesn't make sense... I'm Mozambican and here the service are restricted so we must have to go to the bank and they are not doing the job right. Since the beginning standard bank close they services on 12pm I don't explain why, u.b.a (united bank of Africa) initially the was  the best for now the are not working good, the brand in our country is getting a poor image. I would recommend to see the best to your costumers, we could have the apps to resume our hungry of bad services.Thanks\n",
      "65. Until very recently, I sent money regularly from the UK to a friend in Sierra Leone to help with her nursing studies. I suddenly find that my account is now blocked. Customer Services advise me that 'the system' noticed some irregularities which they are unable to clarify. Unfortunately I cannot use Moneygram ever again.I find their service absolutely appalling. No explanation, no apology, nothing. Disgusting.Despite raising a complaint, Moneygram would still not provide justification for blocking my account.I'd advise people to find another way to support friends abroad trying to pursue honest and worthwhile careers\n",
      "66. THIS IS WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EXPERINCED WITH THE SUPERVISOR VERY UN HELPFULL AND HE FINALLY DISCONNECTED MY CALL . I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND , VERY UN PROFESSIONL STAFFS .\n",

      "68. I really don't have words to describe how horrible this company is, if you need the money to arrive as they say DON'T SEND THROUGH MG! I looked through all the fine print and it clearly said 1-4 business days, but AFTER I sent the money it said it could take up to the 12 th, which I hate when companies change what they advertise, then I asked to cancel and they said it'd take longer to get back than if I just waited for the 12th. I've called several times but they always have different excuses, have no concern that by their falsely advertising 4 business days delivery I'm missing a flight and have people calling me wanting their money, no concern that I don't have money to put food on the table! Not even with a offer of compensation, not that, that would help but just applaud at how they've handled this. It's past the 12th! I'm still waiting😭😡. Never again🤨\n",
      "69. Pathetic.people pay fee to get money same day but the money is not received the same day. Money gram never have cash to pay receivers always use e-transfer, not even $50. Garbage as service.\n",
      "70. Tried to make a wire transfer from CHF to BRL which was debited from my CHF debit card, cancelled unilaterally by MoneyGram without a clear explanation, and not reimbursed immediately to my CHF bank account. I tried to contact through their customer service phone number provided in Switzerland, however it lands in the Lufthansa call center (how bizarre is that?). I then contacted them through their customer form in their website, and received a generic message saying that it can take up to 10 days to get reimbursed. Now I don't have my CHF funds to process the wire transfer with another broker (Wise for example, which I never had any issues with in the past), nor the BRL fund in the receiving account. Looking forward to getting my money back ASAP. Case 37937976.Update Feb 7, 2025: generic response received from MoneyGram as it can be seen below. Customer service is inexistent. Can only recommend to stay away from this platform. Ps: still waiting for my reimbursement.\n",

      "74. MoneyGram has eroded into one of the sleaziest most dishonest transfer services in the world. You have a very good chance of never seeing your money again if you foolishly trust these horrible people. I recently had a terrible experience with MG and I contacted my friend who works with a group who investigates reports of companies and services who are getting numerous complaints. They agreed to investigate MoneyGram and the results were shocking. In the last year the majority of the 5 star reviews are completely FAKE. We know this because we used the Fakespot Review Checker by Mozilla to check and grade all the reviews in the last 12 months. The FRC is highly accurate and uses a high-tech scientific method to check and grade reviews for authenticity. TrustPilot claims to use a similar system but either that software is not as accurate or they simply have too many reviews to scan them all and that's understandable. After scanning all MoneyGram 5 star reviews the FRC gave a true grade of less than 2 stars overall which is a D grade of the A to F scale the FRC uses. This is a very poor rating that proves the majority of 5 star reviews being submitted over 12 months are not from actual customers but planted by MoneyGram to give prospective users a false perception of the deceitful and dishonest way they've been ripping people off. To get the true and actual results from using the MoneyGram service read the 1 & 2 star reviews of which there are thousands. You'll see one nightmare after another of how everyone lost all their money putting their trust in Moneygram. They've become so corrupt and dishonest that the Post Office and all other substantial MG locations in London have completely canceled their contract with MG and refuse to honor their payouts. The same thing is taking place in Australia. My own experience is even more solid proof of just how corrupt this service has become. Last Christmas I used MG for the 1st time to send a small transfer under $50 to my wife in the Philippines from California. I saw they offered a free debit card you could load money onto and use it as a normal bank debit card. So I signed up easily with no ID required and loaded a small amount to test it. I sent my wife half the money on the card and it went through. I left the rest to use as a quick emergency transfer in case my wife suddenly needed cash. Last week her apartment was broken into when she was visiting her mother and among other things taken the thieves cleaned out all of her food which isn't surprising in the Philippines. So she had no food and almost no money. But when I tried to send her the $18 I'd left on the debit card I got a message saying I needed to show a picture ID to complete the transaction. But my state ID expired in January and I couldn't renew because I was deathly ill with the flu, or possibly covid. So I tried using Western Union but MG wouldn't allow me to use the debit card either to send the $18. I called customer service and complained saying \"What kind of scam is this? You didn't ask for ID to deposit the money but now you demand ID to get it back!\". The agent sounded like a robot....\"Our policy requires an ID to continue using the service\". I said \"I don't want to use the service....just give me my money back!\". \"Our policy requires......\". I demanded a supervisor 4 times and he kept lying saying he was the only one I could talk to. He finally gave in and connected me to a supervisor who must've magically appeared somehow. But she was nothing but the female version of him and kept repeating the same thing over & over again \"Our policy.....\". I told her \"You take money with no ID but then you won't give it back without ID....that's just stealing. You actually think that's being fair?\". \"Our policy requires....\". It was unbelievable. The company is completely corrupt and doesn't give a flying you-know-what about you. Only a total fool or someone who doesn't care about losing all their money would use MoneyGram now. Read all the horror stories in the 1 & 2 star reviews and see how safe you feel about giving your money to MoneyGram. It's very likely that's exactly what you'll actually be doing....giving them your money. Every reply given to the reviews is very obviously rubber stamped and completely meaningless. Nearly all of them say the exact same thing that is senseless, worthless, and useless drivel. That is certainly not how a decent caring company replies to it's customers. But they shouldn't have to reply to so many angry customers in the first place if they were doing their job instead of ripping people off.UPDATE: As you can see they gave me their pathetic rubber stamp reply they give to the majority of reviews and it's obviously completely meaningless garbage with no attempt whatsoever to resolve anything. That's because they care nothing about their customers.\n",
      "75. ****Updated****I was trying to send transaction to another country and I was about to finish transaction, while pending I got message that my account was closed. I called customer service and asked what was the reason they closed my account but they did not provide any reason for it. I told them I am ready to provide any info to verify my account and transaction. They simply said \"No\" and bravely confirmed that I can no longer use their online service anymore. This is the worst thing I ever heard as a customer. I don't even have any clue why my account was closed suddenly. This is a trash company. Besides their service fees are much higher compared to fees of similar transaction companies. I don't recommed using Moneygram at all. Stay away at all costs!After leaving a review, Moneygram asked me to contact them again but nothing changed. They did not provide a reason for closing my account nor they did not allow me to reopen it. Very rude customer service\n",
      "76. It’s the most worse experience I ever had in my life. I canceled the transaction, however they did not refund the money back.\n",
      "77. Review of MoneyGram Services in London: A Frustrating ExperienceIf you’re considering using MoneyGram in London, I strongly urge you to think twice. While the platform promises global convenience, the reality is a nightmare if you’re trying to receive money here. The problem isn’t with sending money—MoneyGram makes that process relatively smooth—but with actually finding a location in London where you can receive it.After sending funds internationally, you’d expect to find a reliable network of partners to withdraw your money. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Many of the listed agents in London either no longer exist, refuse to provide MoneyGram services, or are simply non-functional. Some outlets claim they’re “out of cash” or “don’t have the facility,” leaving recipients stranded and frustrated. Even major establishments that should support MoneyGram transactions, such as post offices or shops, often turn customers away with unhelpful responses.The experience of locating a MoneyGram partner that actually fulfills their advertised service becomes an exhausting scavenger hunt. What’s worse, MoneyGram’s customer service seems disinterested in resolving these issues. Their representatives suggest you “try another location,” which is absurd when one after another fails to meet expectations. It seems that the responsibility of ensuring the availability of partner locations is completely neglected.MoneyGram in London might still serve as a viable option for sending money, but without a functional and dependable receiving network, what’s the point? It’s essentially half a service. You might send funds to someone in need, only for them to face the frustrating reality of wandering around London in search of a partner willing to release the money.In conclusion, MoneyGram’s receiving services in London are poorly managed and unreliable. If you’re looking for a dependable way to send money internationally, I’d strongly recommend exploring other providers like Western Union, PayPal, or even bank transfers. Save yourself and your recipient the hassle. MoneyGram’s failures in London make it an option best avoided. So please if you read this , make a change on how MoneyGram works and make MoneyGram branches so we don’t relay your on shops where they never have money to cash out!\n",

      "89. I am still waiting on my refund since 12/31/2024, you guys canceled my transfer so many times and still hold on to my money\n",
      "90. The last I used MoneyGram I sent money to my friend for my Godson in Trinidad. I’m not sure what’s going on, but I wasn’t able to send money directly to her bank account. That was an inconvenience to her. It’s 2025, we need things to make our lives easier.  Get rid of going to pick up money from a location where it’s not easily accessible.\n",
      "91. I used to rely on MoneyGram for my money transfer needs, but nowadays there are many competitors offering better exchange rates and service quality. In recent months, we experienced a major disruption when MoneyGram's services were suspended worldwide, which forced us to look for alternative money transfer solutions.Furthermore, they seem to have little regard for customer loyalty, as they don't offer competitive rates to their long-term customers.I hope MoneyGram can return to its former standard of excellence.\n",
      "92. I tried to send money. :( I was refused.What is the point of signing up with a service that sends money to friends of clients to other countries, only to be refused service? :(\n",
      "93. App doesn't work\n",
      "94. I WAS CHARGED FOR MY NEXT TRANSACTION AFTER I WAS SENT THE OFFER BELOW:We miss seeing you at MoneyGram!Looking for the perfect place to send money? With MoneyGram, you can get £0 fees* and improved exchange rates to bank accounts or for cash pickup in Jamaica.But don’t wait! This offer ends soon.\n",
      "95. I wish it was no star option money gram rates are 💩 I’m sending from here cuz it’s easy and simple. I send money to Bulgaria British £ atm there is 2.40 leva money gram rate is 2.23 that’s a big difference.shame yourself money gram , folks please don’t use this service if you can\n",
      "96. 5£ for single transaction charges its too expensive\n",
      "97. Loyal customer gets lower exchange rate and also have to pay the fees of £1.99.On the other hand new customer gets more rates and don’t have to pay the fees.Worst customer service\n",
      "98. I think your fees are way too high. I have used this company several times and have never had a discount. I am dropping this company. I feel that you price gouge. So, I’m done.\n",
      "99. You band me for no reason,and I could not send money when it really count ,it was very important I was sending 1500 to a friend of mine out of the country and I got band for two weeks. Then when I call the person I talk to was no help to resolve the problem,\n",
      "100. I have tried to log in four times today and it keeps telling me they ran into a problem and the last message told me my browser does not support MoneyGram which is garbage because I use a Google browser and I always have.\n",
      "101. Not only this time it had happened few times in past when i sent money,mone was hold for couole of days without knowwing me. When i called customer service then i found money was hold for security reason. Then i had to go throw some personal informations to released my money. I felt like i was introgated by a farud govt authority. I never face this type of introfation when i sent money by wearern union. It was not a large amount of money only for $1000. I believe i shouldnt went throw this process. Even moneygram never contact me via email or sms to contact customer service for security questions. I told customer service that if they see my record i sent one particular family memebr everymonth same amount of money for family expenses. But i had to go throw same shit 90% of times when i sent money. I decided not to use moneygram service anymore. Because i dont like to go through this process.\n",
      "102. The fees are getting ridiculous expensive need to do better 😤 😪\n",
      "103. I was unable to transfer money. The only was to contact MoneyGram is via either an automated chat line- no help for me- or fill in a contact form. I did get one reply but it did not help. I replied and said this. I tried to transfer money at least 8 times- it was only £65 to the same person but every time it was unsuccessful but I did not know why. Very frustrating as the person I was trying to g to send the money too was desperate.\n",
      "104. They have held my money for more than a week and it’s still marked as processing. I had to use PayPal instead and now I seem to be out of £500. No one can tell me what’s going on or cancel the transaction.\n",
      "105. I like moneygram because my brother used it on sending money abroad, having heard of his experience inspired me to adopt moneygram too. Sending money takes little be longer for example I sent money abroad on 02/02/2025 money was received after two days which requires checking up with the system overseas\n",
      "106. I like it because I can send online, and get discount. I don't like the changes about reasons why I'm sending. And whom I'm sending for etc...I just thought that is private or personal matters. Also changes about name of bank and account numbers. Some of them do not have account numbers, because they only picked up money through remittances. Like cebuana or Llhuieler? Lucky some of them went through without filling out bank info. But one of my receiver did not get it. I had to go to the store and sent it without bank info. By the way, she was told by the teller that there is no account number to give. Thank you very much...\n",
      "107. Not really helping ,thank you for nothing\n",
      "108. If your transfer is cancel due to any reason. Moneygram will not refund your money.They say that money will be refunded in 10 days but you will not get any refund in 10 days. Your money might be refunded if you call them again and again and request for your refund and keep sending emails, as a result they will not give you refund but definitely every time they will give you case # which is a lollipop for you.\n",
      "109. I made transfers reference : 42013938 on 26thPayment is still not received in receiver bank account till today 30th Dec ?  I want the proof of payment deposited in receiver bank account. If by Monday it’s not delivered as you claimed I will contact my bank !\n",
      "110. They refused to honor the transfer and cancelleled it right. BEFORE. Christmas for my relatives in South America who needed it for presents.Terrible and unethical services\n",
      "111. Service when working properly is superMoneygram had outage issues in September. Site was inoperative for something like 10 daysI had to use bank transfer which cost me £19\n",
      "112. My friends and I are unable to send from Latvia.The website rarely works. I've tried several different basic troubleshooting steps. I've informed them, but nothing's been done for a year now. The app is worse. It never works.\n",
      "113. Im very happy to use the money gram because it is very fast to transfer our money to the overseas and iam appreciate for all your services to us\n",
      "114. Moneygram no more available on UK.In Bedford no any centre available to pick up money, and call centre a very useful lady give me wrong information and nearly to close the line when I tell her about wrong information.If look in Internet, said post office no more work but really.... No any shops work with moneygram now. I spend hours and check all shops on my city.\n",
      "115. One of the worst service i have experienced. I am new user to moneygram and I have experienced worst customer service from them. Transaction was cancelled without any reason and money was deducted from bank account. When I talked to customer service. No one was able to help. No one knows what is the cancellation reason. All are uneducated people in the customer service. They are only saying I have to wait for 10 working days to get money credited back to my account. Seriously!!!I have to wait for my own money back where as it was needed urgently to my home country.Its a scam. Be aware!! Dont use this service!! Go with wise.\n",
      "116. My aged mother transferred money from Guinea to Soith Africa to spend time with her haughtier for Christmas 3 weeks ago . The money is still tied up in the system . Your customer service is inept . You are holding my mothers money hostage\n",
      "117. I had very bad experience recently with moneyGram via moneGram app. What they did offer me very good rate which was about 5 rupees higher then current rate but when money received at other end it was 5 rupee less. Now a days everyone locks onto the rate when the transaction is carried out.I think they tricked me or deceivd. I think this practice is wrong and should be stopped and reported as scam .I have complained in the app regarding this but never received any reply from them .\n",
      "118. For sure all those reviews are kind of fake .I live in UK and is the worst experience ever had ,costumer service i would say is the worst.Definitely will never use it again ever as simple is that.\n",
      "119. The worst experience ever. I was supposed to receive transfer in London and no agents in London would pay. After wasting a full half day visiting agents was told to consider switching the transfer to a competitor which I did. But when I go the initial MoneyGram transfer they refused to refund the fees siting that the service was rendered. I of course pushed back saying that it was not the case. Got in touch with Customer Services call center (in the Philippines) and this supervisor lady by the name of Elija was rather condescending. I will never use MoneyGram again and would advice people to stay away from them\n",
      "120. Worst service\n",
      "121. MoneyGram is not at all customer centric. I have lodged a few complaints on why the money that has been sent is not being received by the receiver within the expected due date. the case numbers of the online complaints are 37161447 dt 26/11/24, 37183299 dt 27/11 and 37186224 dt 28/11/24, 37217637 dt 1/12. Did not receive any reply and then lodged a complaint over telephone and the complaint case no is 37274506 dt 6/12/24. As of today, I have not received any reply on all of these. It is highly unsatisfactory.\n",
      "122. I like it because there's a few branches which I don't have to stand in a long queue here in Samoa. I just wish that we have more branches out our ways (Falealili District in Samoa) so we don't have to travel that far. Rate is ok. Service is great.\n",
      "123. Fácil de usar\n",
      "124. The ease of application is good, but I send money to my family to pay for school fees and rent, and you have to reduce the interest because I will send monthly.\n",
      "125. I wanted to send £800 but I was denied access\n",
      "126. Sometimes the app does not respond,  this annoyed me so I change to WU instead.\n",
      "127. Customer service was horrible\n",
      "128. The system was user friendly, I was able to do my transaction in no time. I like that.\n",
      "129. Low rate to Guatemala why too low compared to others\n",
      "130. If I send money to the receiver named Jahangir xxxx( his named still in my receiver list) , you always hold the funds until I ring you and verify his identity. This is absolutely I don’t like, feel embarrass. Why do I have to verify his identity every time I send money to him? I am send money to him from other money transfer agencies and they don’t ask for his identity check before releasing the funds.\n",
      "131. Every time I go to resend to the same person it asks for all the details again. I don’t have time for that. So my go to is Western union and world remit..Ease of use is the key. As soon as your app asks for details , I go straight to the other apps.\n",
      "132. worst service ,,some time took more then a day for transfered the money,,now im using ace which transfer the money within a minute\n",
      "133. Hello thanks for that before everything was ok I always using money gram but unfortunately now my app doesn’t work many time I complain about this but not works\n",
      "134. Not a reliable service.risky .I recently sent money and by mistake I wrote the wrong number so without confirming it that it is the right account they sent money to that account which eventually I have to cancel and yet I have not received my money back\n",
      "135. Other senders rates are better. Customer service nit that good.\n",
      "136. What I dislike with MoneyGram is when you send money you paid a fee and it's too high and especially when it comes during the holidays around Christmas you guys or MoneyGram increase the service fee by double the amount to send money that is not right\n",
      "137. I am very  disappointed  last time I couldn't  send money from uk to lima, it was supposed  to rece in cash ,they asked  you for your  bank account  and name bank and a code too complicated,  it wasn't  like last time I send it. Anyway,  you are not the only one, western  union is doing same. For me that I have  an account  in uk. I have  a bank  account  in Peru. But unfortunately I couldn't  do it. No more money gram\n",
      "138. I like that your people can receive the money in the second. I dislike that when I sent a certain amount you start questioning however you have all the information that I am working. This is delayed my operation.\n",
      "139. Have issues transferring funds into a bank account from uk to Jamaica!\n",
      "140. Money gram was out of service for few months I was disappointed we didn’t have no reason why the service wasn’t working at that time the rates was high and that was a lost on my side because I had to send money to my family.\n",
      "141. your codes for dicount savings neverrrr work\n",
      "142. It is very excellent in the speed of receiving money from any ATM in the world. I am very happy with this.\n",
      "143. I like it's fast but the rate is high then ria that's way I use them\n",
      "144. I gave a three star not because the service is poor, in fact I've had a seamless experience using the service, however, due to the fact that you have remove Royal mail from us being able to receive money, I've had to switch to Western Union just to receive cash.\n",
      "145. In the past two months I experiences some issues with their app. It used to work well in the past but not any longer. For example, last month I wanted to send £100, and had just one transaction. Then noticed that moneygram deducted £200 from my account. I got refund but still it should not have happened. Also these days I'm struggling to long into my account . It was a five star app but not any longer. Sort out your app please.\n",
      "146. The transfer is very slow. I do not know why the transaction showed cancel. The app is not working all the time. Then the exchanged rate is different when I am going to send. Example when I check the exchange rate from UK Sterling Pound to Ph peso it shows 76+ but when I am going to send it shows 73+  the after sending it shows in my email the transaction was cancelled.\n",
      "147. Difficult App to navigate. Asked for bank details of recipient , but I wanted them to be picking up money at an agent. Then paid it direct to bank, offered no choice. Will try with another recipient in a different country.\n",
      "148. Very hard to login into my account and every month having problem to send money for my loved ones!Very disappointed 😞\n",
      "149. I was on darlaston Wednesbury post office staff dont no how to spek with costumer very rude and I send money in india I show address and and name but staff put wrong name on address and I was go back to the post office they start argument with\n",
      "150. I sent money on the app to my daughter. I live in the UK and she lives in the USA. She was in desperate need of this money for her electric bill. It was a weekend and it said on the app 0 -1 business days. It said the money was on its way. But it didn't arrive for 3 days. My daughters electricity was shut off and she has my 9 year old grandson in her home. If I has gone to a store that has Money Gram she would have received the money instantly. I don't feel the app is very good if someone needs money on the same day, because they will have to wait up to 5 business days for the money to clear their account. I couldn't do anything because you had already taken the money out of my bank account with in minutes of me sending the money. Yet my daughter had to wait 3 days to receive it.\n",
      "151. Wish i could give them a below 0 star. They dont deserve to even exist in Australia. All the locations mentioned on their website is not true. Most of them dont even exist or if they do then they dont offer the service. I drove for 3 hours from one place to the other trying to receive money. The agents are very small businesses and most of the time they dont have enough money to give out. Tried the chat line and when i advised about the incorrect information they ended the chat automatically saying there was a system error and i should try again. Please DO NOT use money gram.\n",
      "152. My cousin sent some money via moneygram and I have been visiting 10+ locations to receive money. All they say is you can send money but cannot receive as they don't have enough people sending money using moneygram. In the cold weather I need to walk into different locations to get this money. Think 1000 times before you deal with moneygram.\n",
      "153. Everything was working well with moneygram until you introduced Trustly. My bank is called Metrobank and it operates many branches in southeast England. Yet it does not appear on the Trustly list of banks and I therefore cannot complete my transaction.I submitted this problem to you three weeks ago and have heard nothing since.\n",
      "154. Hello I’m happy 😃 enjoy 😉 whit money gram and quick service\n",
      "155. I need to be able to set up monthly payments. The instructions are incomprehensible.\n",
      "156. The system failed, so the transaction was delayed.\n",
      "157. I used Money Gram to send money on December 2nd.I had a code you guys sent me to waive the fees and it didn't work. I reached out to you guys and so far the issue has not been resolved.\n",
      "158. repeated problems sending money with no explanation as to why the process was being denied. expensive fees, no discount for processing online versus going to a brick and morter location. i will be going back to western union\n",
      "159. It's easy to use but it taking so long to send money to receiver unlike the other money transfer website like Western Union  remitty etc this site once dey debit you then the receiver got it in 10 min but money gram  take 3 to 4 days please work on it\n",
      "160. I don’t find any reproach about your service. Everything is fine.\n",
      "161. The fee are a little bit high\n",
      "162. I sent money to the wrong account I canceled it so I can resend it and money gram won't give me or refund the fee back..I will never use money gram anymore..you lost my business forever\n",
      "163. I tried to cancel a transfer that said it was in process. They couldn’t help me\n",
      "164. Before money\n",
      "165. I luv this but recently when i tried to send money something happend and transaction got cancelled. To get that money back it took me 5days.We arr sending money for emergencys most of the time . When something happened like this we arre in trouble. Please looking to this matter.\n",
      "166. Services is fast and reliable but poor decision making I just got disable without doing anything wrong with my fund on it\n",
      "167. It took 2 to 3 days for the recipient to receive the money sent while on your application, it says 10-minutes. That was not good at all. Customer service person was not professional at all and it took him long time to fix the money transfer. The fees still higher than other money transfer institutions.\n",
      "168. Location where I went there system had went down whe they where doing my transactions. They advise me o go to a different location. So I went to a different location . My reference number wasn’t comming up so I called MoneyGram and they said I had picked up my transfer already. Which I didn’t .\n",
      "169. I use your service primarily to send funds to a relative in Serenje, Zambia. Your two agents there no longer serve you, but you continue to advertise that they do. In consequence, I had to cancel my initial transaction and make a second to another relative in Lusaka, Zambia instead. This was inconvenient for me and my relatives, and your fault for not keeping your database up to date. Nevertheless, you charged me £4.99!\n",
      "170. What I don't like about this company is the high prices of the fees for money transfers.What I like most is the speed with which the money reaches its destination.\n",
      "171. We need good rate when we want to send money to overseas, but nowadays rate is very poor, we are not satisfiedThank you\n",
      "172. Not interested to discuss\n",
      "173. Wouldn’t use Moneygram to receive money in the UK. You terminated your contract with the post office and your services have just gone downhill. The remaining agencies working for you are just not good because they don’t give you money when you are receiving from a sender. Fix your shit with the Post Office and you will get a good review.\n",
      "174. What  I like was conveniet and easy to use.\n",
      "175. It takes too long for the recipient to receive the money. Other services are instant. Mine took over 24hours\n",
      "176. Hello, unfortunately I can no longer use the program. It seems that there is a problem.\n",
      "177. Denial to send money,  problems when at both ends, poor service\n",
      "178. Preference based exchange rates offer had bad experience won’t use the service again\n",
      "179. Refund processing takes long, sometimes you found out that will be last money in my account and have to wait for 10 days. If  there is a mistake it's should be fixed in 2 days\n",
      "180. It takes so long for the third party to receive the money, which is why I prefer Western Union. Why do we need to re-enter the number where we send the money to? Please see how Western Union designs theirs and if you can improve it to theirs it would help very much.\n",
      "181. UK cash pick-up? Since cancelling the contract with the Post Office, Tesco etc, I have not been able to pick up money from the remaining locations due to them not 'having any or enough money'. There are around 10 small locations which are usually tiny grocery stores. They tell me to come back in a few days, but when I do someone else has already taken the money. After contacting Moneygram to offer a solution where I could receive a bank transfer instead (especially seeing as they now have £1500 of money to give me), I was told I could have the money transferred. I was then told, I could not have the money transferred to my bank and that the sender would need to cancel all the transactions, request a refund, and send the money again via bank transfer. Crap service. Cheap.  Update 9th Dec - since requesting the refund, the sender was told it would take up to 15 days and WILL NOT include the sending fee. If they want to include the sending fee, it will take 3 months?! Are these companies real in the head?\n",
      "182. I have been using moneygram for over 3 years to send money to my family in Gabon Africa. I recently sent a payment  of $400 to my family and it did not arrive to them but Money gram said it was delivered. But it was not received. It seems I have no leg to stand on but for me, that money is need for essentials - food. So while my family starves, Moneygram a rich company says they cannot help.\n",
      "183. The worst customer experience! My transaction was stopped, and since I didnt get any information on why, and the customer service never got back to me, I wanted to cancel my transaction. But after several emails without answer, I had to call them and talk to some person that spoke very bad english, and they couldn't cancel my transaction before giving them a lot of information that I didn't have. So I can't cancel my own transaction so Moneygram has my money and I will not get it back.\n",
      "184. Horrible experience, policies and customer service, I made a transaction on Nov. 20, 15 days later my family have not recieved the money and according to their policies I have to wait 25- 90 days to get my own money back, it left my account less than 5 minutes after I did the transaction but they are making me wait 25-90 days to get my money back.. that is a joke, also I do not have a problem with them having their customers services in other countries, a lot of big companies do, but at least hire some people who speak english, is hard to understand these people who do not speak the same language, . I have used money gram from over 15 years but this is it, they just lost a customer and with all these other companies coming up doing better services, faster and cheaper, I hope that they go out of business..\n",
      "185. Signed up and made a transaction through Topcashback. After waiting 6 months for the promised cashback, Moneygram have failed to pay out. It demonstrates their nonexistent level of trustworthiness. I won't be using their services again and I would warn people of trusting this company with their money.\n",
      "186. This is the worst app for scams and frauds. I reported fraud as soon as I was aware. Moneygram disabled my account and stated that they will not return my funds even it is fraud. MG policy is we do not refund fraud. If the fraudster collects money then they will definitely not refund. Apparently they are contractually obliged to give money to them even if you report the fraud. I complained and they continue to give the same response. Please stay away from this app as you are not protected from fraud\n",
      "187. I would certainly not recommend MoneyGram as a way to send money abroad. On the 31st October I sent 180 GBP to New Zealand to cover my grandchildren’s birthday and Christmas presents. I unfortunately transposed the last two numbers on the form which I completed on their internet form so it has been confirmed by KiwiBank that the money was received by them but it was immediately sent back to the initiator because the account number I put didn’t exist.  I have sent so many emails, I have telephoned and done live chats and I am no nearer to MoneyGram solving my situation and to be honest I am really disappointed by the whole process.\n",
      "188. Scammers be aware!! Still not refunded failed transaction for 546$, customer support is useless! Stay away!!Made a transaction on October 13, it was cancelled by their system immediately, however it was never delivered back to my  bank account. First they told me to wait for a week to process a refund but it has been almost two month and there is still no money back in my account. They keep telling me to contact my bank which I did already multiple times. Bank says Monegram never sent it back and are a Scam company.Please do yourself a favour and stay away!!\n",
      "189. Sometimes the system is not working properly it wont open or cant send money, i hope that you will fix it. Thank u\n",
      "190. Receiver couldn't pick up the money..the information was wrong at the receiver's end.\n",
      "191. I did send money via Moneygram as usual, and the area  they didn't have and agent to do pay out, but according to your website it was showing availability of service in the Hwange area in Zimbabwe, pay out area was 6 hours away and for this reason cancellation you guys would not give me my full refund, I don't think thus fair coz you lied to say there was an agent to do the pay out in Hwange area.\n",
      "192. I am extremely frustrated with MoneyGram's handling of my account suspension. My account was suddenly locked without any prior warning or clear explanation. While I understand the need for security measures, the lack of transparency and communication from MoneyGram has been deeply disappointing.I was informed that my account was flagged as \"high risk\" for fraud or scams, but no specific details were provided. I’ve repeatedly reached out to MoneyGram for clarification and offered to provide proof of my identity, including my passport, driving license, tenancy agreement, and bank statements, yet I have received no meaningful response or guidance on how to resolve the issue.The entire process feels automated and impersonal, leaving me with no clear path to unlocking my account or addressing the concerns raised. As a loyal customer who has followed MoneyGram’s terms and conditions, this experience has been disheartening and inconvenient.I strongly urge MoneyGram to improve their customer service by:Providing detailed reasons for account suspensions.Offering clear, step-by-step instructions to resolve account issues.Ensuring customers have access to live support representatives for urgent concerns.Until these improvements are made, I would advise potential users to consider other money transfer services that offer better communication and customer support.\n",
      "193. I am unable to complete my money transfer as usual for an unknown reason - your services are unable to fix it.\n",
      "194. My experience, for moneygram, good because two years i always use moneygram, and i send money to my country Timor Leste well, and to Indonesia well.and i'm so grateful for the Moneygram. Today and for the foreseeable future. Thank you.\n",
      "195. Western union give better rate for same region.Also less transfer fees\n",
      "196. Love their fast reliable services\n",

      "2. I placed a transfer on July 3, 2025 and the estimated completion date was July 10, 2025 (Transfer ID CAF806ED).  As of July 11, I didn't received the money.  I called and email  customer service several times on the next few days.  They told me the bank is doing a compliance review with no additional information.  On July 17, 2025 they sent me an email asking for information requested by the bank.  It took almost two weeks of inactivity to ask for additional information (clarification on the text I entered on the Reference optional field!).  I provided the requested information a few hours later and as of today, July 18 at 8:30 pm I have no information on when the money is going to be release.  I'm not happy at all with this transaction.  I spent more than 2 hours on the phone and several emails so far.\n",
      "3. Don't even try to open an account with them. I tried for 3 companies of mine to open an account that are doing normal activities and none of them can get an account because to much risk???? A little strange, so better open an account with wise or Paysera, at least they don't do so difficult and have low to no expenses. When you try to call the Ireland number, it is always not available.\n",
      "4. I wrote a critical review of OFX which has not appeared.In my experience this company is expensive, unprofessional, unresponsive. They took a A$1000 forex spread on an $90,000 transfer from Sydney to Hong Kong and took over a week to make this transfer. I had to call and email them to find out why the delay and they then kept saying the information they had received was incorrect. I resent it more than once. not once did they initiate a call to me saying they needed more information.OFX is a second rate outfit - perhaps they are good in Australia(?) but they should not venture into a competitive environment.\n",
      "5. I sent a transfer for $2,000 on June 9th, 2025. This transfer was sent from my personal account in the US to my personal account in Mexico. I sent the money on June 9th, 2025 and as of today July 11th, 2025 I have not received it in the destination account.I was told that they could not do the transfer due to \"compliance\" reasons. Not sure what the issue is as I have sent many transfers with them without a problem.So I requested they return my funds and cancel the transaction. After countless emails, they are still holding my USD with no end in sight. I consider that I will need to contact my state regulators to get my funds returned...They are advising I \"recall\" the funds, but this is not possible because the account I sent the funds from is no longer open as I changed banks... So it looks like they just keep the money instead of offering to return it!!\n",
      "6. My transfer took three weeks, and I only discovered the funds had not been sent when the recipient contacted me.  I have subsequently been told the reason for this was that my account was undergoing a standard client review, but OFX did not advise me of this, or that there would be several weeks delay to the transfer.Fortunately the amount involved was not large, but had it been for a very large amount then loss of interest over several weeks could have been quite significant.OFX should advise customers of such delays in advance.\n",
      "7. It's been the approx 10th time i use this platform (the previous 9 times everything worked AWESOMELY) which i like very much for its simplicity: you go online, you input a need in a currency and you strike a deal.Everything follows that: communication to my bank of the detail of the transfer (with consequent phone calls, messahes, signature of papers, etc etc).This time, out of the blue, i rec'd a message the following day, from OFX, that you guys tried to call me (not true) and that i had to call immediately a number (no country nor code specified) otherwise the deal would be cancelled. Tried to call that number, without success and obviously i called the cancellation.Rec'd a phone call 8hrs later (so you can reach me by phone if you want) from a person who \"gave me the possibility out of goodwill to waive the cancellation fee\". Shameful is not enough of an adjective to define OFX performance in this very case.\n",
      "8. First Time to change my savings. You approved you unapproved and now my funds are in limbo unreturned. It's not a week. I've emailed. No response.\n",
      "9. Two issues:1. Transfers from the USA take a much longer period of time to process than from their other branches.2. After sending funds overseas to buy a house, three months later their customer risk department decided I was a money launderer and closed my account- and this was AFTER I responded to their request and sent them a copy of the house purchase.\n",
      "10. I’ve canceled a payment and they asked for more information which I provided. It’s now been more than 3 days that I have not gotten a response and it’s really concerning. I’ve been following up every day. Especially because you are a business dealing with money and provide 24/7 service, you should respond quickly. The fact that I have not gotten a response is unacceptable. This makes me think that this company is a scam and I’m terrified I won’t get my money back.\n",
      "11. the transfer had its glitches and took days longer to transact even though there were no errors with account details etc.the one impressive thing in this matter was the application of OFX operative Sasha Chen who followed up and tracked the misfires and kept us informed, even though the details were often hard for her to attain.her care and concern were much appreciated.\n",
      "12. Worst customer service ever\n",
      "13. You are a terrible company to deal with.  It has taken almost ten days for the people to get their money in London so they can come to the USA.  I will never use your company again and I am in the travel business for 52 years and send money to Germany, France, Israel etc. for groups that we handle.\n",
      "14. For the second consecutive month I had to phone to get the funds transferred. Different excuses, this time I transferred the funds immediately on a Friday and received a reply acknowledging receipt. The funds had not been received by the following Tuesday, telephoned OFX to be told it was due to a weekend followed by a Bank Holiday in New Zealand. Not aware that computers knew this!!! The funds were received within the hour. Will not be using OFX again.\n",
      "15. OFX has replaced security with bureaucracy. Very difficult to deal with recently.\n",
      "16. They are holding 85 bands of mine even after I sent every document. Locked my account again during currency crisis. Same problem as before. They already had my papers but kept asking again. For what. This isn't how you treat clients. I am done risking big money here. Maybe it works for small flips or vacation trades not for serious forex. Only place that does it right. Global Landscape. Fast execution every time.Nothing else comes close.\n",
      "17. MGMT.Please do not use OFX. They have stolen my money and ignore all emails. Clown show!\n",
      "18. Despite them asking me to email them - they still don't respond! Clown show.*Update - still being ignored by them!\n",
      "19. This company has all the hallmarks of a financial services business riddled with financial mismanagement at best and fraud at worst. It has been a horrible experience dealing with them from start to finish. Drip feeding outrageous requests for additional information for 'compliance reasons' and then after all of these have been provided still sitting on the funds for extended periods while they 'review them'. Not to mention advertised rates only being available after you call them directly to query why the standard platform rates are so much worse. Many other red flags along the way also.\n",
      "20. We trusted OFX to deliver our funds to the Philippines for a building project. BUT what we found is that they have many questions AFTER receiving the money by bank wire.   All these questions could have been asked PRIOR to funds transmittal, yet they chose not to do so. It is almost blackmail when they hold your money and keep making additional and additional inquiries without doing any research themselves. They use a bank in NYC as a transfer agent, and it took three plus weeks after telling OFX to return our funds until the return was finally made.  My advice to future customers is that if you do choose to do business with these people, before sending them any money let them inquire all they want without holding your money hostage. Personally I would rather pay the extra fees to Wells Fargo to transmit money than to put up with OFX's nonsense and delays.You will notice in their reply they avoided the issue which is to get your money first and ask questions later.  So they hold your funds hostage to what they think their regulations are.  Instead I used Wells Fargo, an institution governed by the same regulations, and did not face any problems (unnecessary questions used to delay and hold your money) or delays.\n",
      "21. Ridiculously long time to transfer. Usually it is a swift transfer\n",
      "22. away from them!!if i can give a zero star i would defo to!!!i transfer the money to them by debit card a two weeks ago and ask them to transfer it to my is brokage account.however they keep finding different excuses to stop transfer it to( keep asking for a document that i dont really have, like invoice or contract, i told them it is purely an personal and individual account not a business accoumt so i dont have those documents). this consume me around a week to two weeks to explain. and finally i still unable to transfer it to my us brokage account.then i ask them to return back to account in uk. they keep telling me anx confirm this has been completed the transferring, however up to now i m still not yet receive my money back to my account. that spend me around 5 days.right now i need to report the police and  try to get back of my money, i am very worry about can i get my money back from them.i called them a lot of time and they always give me a different excuses not to pay back of my money.i have report it to the police and right now i am worry about can i get back my moneyI asked them to provide me a proof of refund but they keep telling me my requests was forwarded to relevant departments. and never seeing my money back!\n",
      "23. Stay away! Terrible experience - 7400 KCHF failed transfer. Was supposed to be a very simple transfer. I have proven to OFX that all information was entered correctly by me. Money lost since 3 weeks. OFX has no clue what they are doing, and absolutely no urgency to locate the funds. Either OFX is fraudulent or very incompetent.\n",
      "24. Incapable to do a transfer from France in € to my other personal account in USD in the PANDA COMMERCIAL BANK of Phnom PenhI did the same day with the same montant 100€ with REMITRY who was successed with only 5 days\n",
      "25. Reliable however takes several days for the $ to be transferred\n",
      "26. We were previously users of your platform during the OzForex days in 2020 but discontinued our use at the time due to limited UI and platform Xero integration. Recently, noticed the improvements and promising integrations the new platform now offers, which encouraged us to re-engage with OFX.Following our registration for a demo with Luke C., we were informed that our existing account would need to be reactivated. We promptly provided all the updated details required for reactivation on 29th March.However, as of today, 23rd April, we have yet to receive confirmation of our account being migrated. Despite multiple follow-up attempts via phone and email, we have only received repeated assurances that the process will be completed “next week,” without any tangible progress.Seems like the OFX today is great on marketing the new platform but not so great on the customer service. Ended up with AIRWALLEX which also seems to also do the job. Good Luck.\n",
      "27. I booked an research international wire transfer on April 7th.After 11 days of constant  phone calls and entering in my bank details,  they still failed to do a penny credit test.The deal expired April 15 yet on April 14 they said they would do a penny test credit which would take a few days. Then they canceled the deal and had the gall to send me an email on April 17th congratulating me on a successful  transfer.Sheer incompetence and a waste of 10 days and they were completely  unable to help me.\n",
      "28. I would agree with the below with compliance issues m.  They are withholding 60,000 usd of mine even thought they have all the paperwork. For the second time in a currency crisis they have locked my account even though they have every piece of transparency. Asking twice for things they have: I’m moving as they can’t be trusted when needed and I don’t want to risk moving a large amount of money with them based on below:  ok for holidays but for proper large forex go elsewhere\n",
      "29. OFX has been withholding AUD$518,565 of my company funds for more than a year now. Also they conducted multiple unauthorized transactions from our account post-closure.OFX has failed to respond to multiple complaints, including those filed with the Better Business Bureau and previously with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), breaching your terms of service and consumer protection obligations.We submitted fraud reports against OFX to DFI, FinCEN and CFTC for multiple violations of their money transmitter license obligations.Know this - it's not the bank. It will be very hard to bring them to any responsibility as they are another offshore (Australia) owned money transmitter business with a local US subsidiary company.The company is absolutely ignorant to any of our direct communication. Stay away from them - it's a scam operation without any customer support whatsoever.\n",
      "30. Shockingly hopeless from the beginning and remains ongoing. For what should have been a simple transaction from my bank to OFX account I'd set up to send family inheritance overseas has 3k missing, so from then till now over 25 emails same with phone calls always different agents they keep requesting more and more information NOT about the missing money but where did I get it. The family WILL apparently wasn't enough. To add insult to injury they asked if I was going to make up the shortfall.....even with detailed proof of transfer from my bank.\n",
      "31. You guys do great workThank you\n",
      "32. OFX used to be great and I had transferred many thousands through them as I was working overseas several years ago. Now the quality of their support and compliance teams has fallen off a cliff. I needed to increase my ACH/direct debt limits and it has taken no less than 5 phone calls and 10 email back and forth messages with a dozen documents uploaded.Nobody seems to be able to follow the thread, I'm repeatedly asked for the same document only to be told they need it again, or the support staff have no idea what documents are needed. Response times are measured in days instead of hours. Calls to support get disconnected on transfer, emails are full of typos and incorrect information.OFX what happened? I preferred you over Wise due to having better support and rates. Now I'm not sure if I can trust you with my money any longer. My issue is still not resolved, a large transfer is in limbo with money taken from my account and communication is incredibly poor.\n",
      "33. The process to complete a business account its very tedious, ask for very sensitive information before even securing a log in account. So, after going to the whole process the system doesn't let me log in, customer service its very slow and not very efficient. I'm having second thoughts about using their service. I might just go to my bank of America locally and send the wire. At this time not sure if to use it at all much less for sending large amounts to Europe.\n",
      "34. Exchange Rates are too high, then add on $15 transaction fee. However, I did notice on this last transaction that the transaction fee was waived.\n",
      "35. Last December 2024, I did a review on OFX and gave them 5 starsMy deal was done on a Thursday late afternoon, and it was completed on the Saturday early morning.What a few months can do.This time I gave them 3 stars but it should probably be a 2 or even a 1 star.Why should a company get 3 stars just for doing what they are supposed to do?March 2025This time I did their recommended, easist and fastest transfer method, for so they told me and it took 5 days.It took less than 12 hours for them to take my money directly from my bank account but it took them 4 days to transfer the funds.I sent multiple emails for someone to look into my transfer only to be told that 4 days is the fastest they can do.My wife uses a competitor and the funds get transferred within a few hours.I'll know better next time.\n",
      "36. OFX, in its staggering ineptitude, stands as a monument to corporate incompetence and bureaucratic absurdity. My recent experience with this so-called service was nothing short of a farcical ordeal, a masterclass in how to alienate and infuriate a customer with needless complexity and outright inefficiency. Allow me to elucidate.I embarked upon what should have been a trivial transaction: the transfer of a modest sum of $2000 between two accounts, both of which are unequivocally mine, bearing my own name. One might assume such a task would be executed with ease, a mere flick of the wrist in the digital age. Alas, no. OFX, in its infinite ineptitude, transformed this simple act into a labyrinthine nightmare.First, I was subjected to their exhaustive biometric KYC process, a procedure so intrusive it might have been lifted from the pages of a dystopian novel. A real-time voice call followed, as if my digital fingerprints and photographic evidence were insufficient to prove my identity. Having jumped through these hoops, I was granted the illusory \"green light\" to proceed. Foolishly, I believed the worst was behind me.I initiated the transfer, only to be met with a fresh barrage of demands: additional KYC documentation, each request more superfluous than the last. With patience I did not know I possessed, I complied, providing every scrap of evidence they demanded. A week passed—a week!—and still, my funds languished in OFX’s clutches. It was only when I threatened legal action that they deigned to respond, and even then, their demands grew more ludicrous. They insisted on proof that I had sent the money—proof I had already furnished—and subjected me to further delays. Nine days. Nine days to return my own money to me. Such staggering incompetence defies belief.Let us pause to consider an analogy, shall we? Imagine purchasing a $2000 laptop from a store. You submit to a biometric ID process, prove your payment account is legitimate, and pay for the item. Your bank verifies the transaction. Yet, the store refuses to hand over the laptop. Instead, they demand your employment history, salary, payslips, and bank statements to determine if you can \"afford\" the purchase. Then, they take days to decide whether to release the item. Would any rational person tolerate such behavior? Of course not. The store would be shunned, its reputation in tatters. Yet, this is precisely how OFX operates—a Kafkaesque parody of customer service.OFX’s conduct is not merely inefficient; it is insulting. It is the institutional equivalent of treating every customer as though they were a suspect in a criminal investigation. The sheer audacity of their demands, coupled with their glacial pace, is an affront to basic principles of commerce and decency. If you derive pleasure from being treated with suspicion and contempt, then by all means, patronize OFX. For the rest of us, there are simpler, saner alternatives. A direct bank transfer, for instance, accomplishes in hours what OFX cannot manage in days.This debacle is emblematic of why traditional finance (TradFi) is hemorrhaging trust and relevance in the face of decentralized finance (DeFi). Companies like OFX, with their byzantine processes and utter disregard for customer dignity, are the architects of their own obsolescence. They are not merely failing their customers; they are actively driving them away.In conclusion, OFX is a cautionary tale, a case study in how not to conduct business. Save yourself the indignity and avoid this wretched service at all costs.\n",
      "37. Made a transfer request 10 Mar, paying with debit card. Approved the transfer in my bank app ~ back to OFX website and was presented with an error screenFollowed up 3 days later, and was asked to send screenshots of a bank statement, the bank payment etc6 phone calls later and 2 more days, eventually they relented and processed the transaction.Oddly, the payment by debit card has since disappeared as an option ..Have used them for years, but more, I'm afraid\n",
      "38. My main problem this time was that the transfer I requested from my Belgian account to my UK account hadnot occurred 6 days later. When I queried this I was told OFX had no record of any transfer request. When I then sent all the details of the move out of my Belgian account the money was found and the transfer completed. I was not informed however what the problem had been.\n",
      "39. Well, I am very disappointed that the payment has been failed, because the counter bank in Panama refused this. The internal policy of the bank says they can't receive transfers from OFX.  As institution first you have to be sure transfers are possible.\n",
      "40. My transaction was forgotten about -had to send 2 emails to wake them up - Feb 12 start and money still not transferredHow can I trust this company\n",
      "41. DONT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR MONEY. Been nearly a month since transfer initiated and they took my money. Still haven't received funds in new currency. They keep sending me links to do that don't work. No one knows what is going on. All words, no action. Or perhaps they are deliberately being dishonest and slowing fund transfers to either earn interest or steal it when they go broke. Will be switching to WISE and telling everyone who will listen DO NOT USE OFX. I've sent them clients in the past but NEVER AGAIN. Hah this form asks date of this experience. As in one date. This has been going on all month!\n",
      "42. This company holds onto your money for much longer than they communicate, provide excuses consistently that don't make sense and aren't in line with the status of my funds and communication within the app. Their staff have on numerous occasions provided timelines to me that have blown past and have told me that they have actioned steps when they have not (only discovering upon a second or third phone call for follow up). I have wasted hours and hours of my life trying to get through to them on the phone. Every transfer, small to large, seems to require ongoing follow up, chasing up and effort. I was provided an 'Account Manager' on email and since then noone has replied to a single email I have sent. I have sat on hold for hours at a time to them with noone picking up... currently sat on hold yet again for another 20 minutes with no answer as they have failed to action a refund properly.Update: noone has reached out to me despite the message below. 🤷🏻‍♀️\n",
      "43. I had great expectations after reading the reviews on OFX. This was my first transfer which I began with transferring British Pounds on Wednesday 12/02/2025 to my bank account in Turkey. Normally I expect the transfer to take between 1 - 2 hours, or as a new customer about 1 day.  Started off with setting up a new account, password and setting up myself as a beneficiary in Turkey.I now begun the transfer with setting up a \"Deal\" (transaction) on 12/02/2025 at 12:21.  I received an email at 12:41 saying my funds had been received.  All well so far.I had numerous emails from OFX to confirm my identity, the location of where the money was to be transferred to, etc.. See below.At 13:38 I received my first email \"Deal Booked - Urgent Action Required\" - They required me to phone them (International phone call) for a \"quick conversation\", which if I did not call them they threatened to cancel the transfer!  This I did.The next day on the 13/02/2025 @ 11:05 I received another email asking me to confirm my current location - apparently requested by their compliance team. - Again I replied and even sent the google map reference as I know the maps in our area of Turkey are a bit vague.  At 14:05 I asked for an update on my transfer and when I could expect to receive it - it's now 24 hours since I began the transfer.  They replied and said they would keep me up to date but could expect the initial transfer to take up to 48 hours. Also that should I wish to adjust my deal I would need to call them.  This is when I first called them and asked them to either complete the transfer that day or cancel the transfer.On the 14/02/2025 @ 10:00 I sent an email why it had now taken 48 hours and still no update as to when I should expect the money.  They responded that I should expect the transfer to take between 1 - 2 days. Sureley that's the same as 48hrs?!Now on 15/02/2025 @ 12:30 they respond with an update - \"I have reached out to our Compliance Team for an urgent update.  As its the weekend we may not have a response until Monday.\"Monday will now be 5 days, a lot longer than the 48 hrs or the 1-2 days as promised.On Sunday, 16/02/2025 @ 12:19 they sent me an email saying \"For security reasons, we need to verbally confirm your transfer over the phone.\"  This I did when the transfer was first set up. Anyway, another international phone call (I'm getting a bit irked by now) and I again reiterate, complete the transfer on Monday or cancel the transfer and return the funds.Now Monday 17/02/2025 @ 15:16 I received the following email \"Our compliance team have completed their review on your account and its now clear to deal.Your funds will be paid out in the next batch today and will clear into the account the same day, sometimes overnight.\"Strangely, no funds!!On the 18/02/2025 @ 02:01 I receive the email \"I can confirm that your account was cleared for us to pay out your TRY funds today, however TRY funds are routed through our bank in the USA, and it is a holiday there today. Your funds should be sent tomorrow, and cleared and available by February 20.\"They even had the gall to send me an email 1 hour later saying \"We want to let you know that funds have now been paid into the recipient account(s) specified.\"  This was sent just after they said I won't get my funds until the 20th February!!Now 8 days after the set up of the transfer and me having sent my money. I still have not received the funds. I have lost 1,800.00 Turkish Lira from then holding onto my transfer rate from 13/02/2025 but only paying out the Turkish Lira 1 week later.  They did not following my instructions on two occasions to cancel the transaction.  So PLEASE BEWARE. How many other customers funds have they held onto for a week, gained interest and and made a killing in exchange rate increases? Some poor customer support staff member has to put up with my frustration as their company rips people off and profits form their so called \"compliance team\". How can compliance take a week, unless you want to draw it out?!Finally, 19/02/2025 @ 12:04 I have received an email from my bank – money received.It has taken OFX 7 days to complete this transaction at a loss of 1,800.00 Turkish Lira which in the past other companies take between 1 to 2 hours, and even on first transfers a maximum of 2 days.\n",
      "44. This company is holidng my 13k Eur for more than a month . I gave everything these guys requested but they still have BLOCK on my account.

Well having used ofx for over a decade without a problem, its all ended in tears today.I made a significant trade and was waiting for my funds to be available, when OFX want the ins and outs of my financial life, which I do not want to provide, moreover I'm on holiday so don't have the info.So now I'm stuck, they have £20K of my money and I wait their reply. You can call them but the wait time is excessive.They did not tell me they would be needing all this info when I made the trade. They never needed it before.I have asked them to send my sterling back, no response yet\n",

An alarming slide in OFX customer serviceI went to log on to our account today with a trade. needed to do only to find \"locked out\" to \"protect your security\" except it was for KYC update.This prevented me from making an important tradeOFX is thus TOTALLY UNRELIABLE, with a utter disregard for its long term customeruPDATE, see how they take zero responsibility , there was no need to lock the account . Have you ever heard of email or telephone? . DisgustingI will be changing brokers acter 25 years.\n",
      "47. I  arranged two deals and OFX transferred one in USD to a travel company in South Africa this was to pay for the Zimbabwe part of the trip. This was carried out When I asked OFX to transfer ZAR to the company they refused as the compny traded in Zimbabwe saying \"Zimbabwe is a banned country\" and rhey could not transfer it. Yet they had already transfered the USD to the company.They then said I still had two trades to go when I had one only left.\n",
      "48. Warning About OFX and Their Handling of Customer Funds 🚨I’ve had a deeply disappointing experience with OFX, a company that claims to provide reliable money transfer services. A recent transaction involving $81k was processed incorrectly, and despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, my funds have been withheld without explanation or action.I was told the transaction was mistakenly initiated and that my funds were being held due to an unresolved issue on their end. The ACH debit was made, but the payment never came through as agreed. To make matters worse, there has been zero communication from their support team, leaving me in the dark with no timeline for resolution.This kind of service is unacceptable. Holding customers' funds without transparency or a clear plan for resolution is unethical. I was informed that the issue should have been handled by my bank, but OFX has failed to take responsibility for correcting the error.To anyone thinking of using OFX, be cautious. They have shown a complete lack of professionalism, and I am now forced to seek legal assistance to get the matter resolved. I strongly recommend you consider other options when transferring large sums of money.\n",
      "49. Important Consumer Warning: OFX Handling of Funds 🚨I’ve recently had an extremely frustrating experience with OFX, a money transfer service, regarding a significant transaction involving $81,000.00. Despite following all the necessary procedures and providing required documentation, my funds have been withheld without any clear communication or resolution.The transaction was initiated by the company, and while the ACH debit was processed, the payment was never made as promised, and no response has been provided to resolve the issue. After contacting their team multiple times, I’ve received nothing but silence.In my experience, this is unacceptable service, especially when customers' hard-earned money is involved. In fact, the merchant responsible confirmed the withdrawal was a mistake, and they stated that the issue should have been handled by the bank – not by sitting on customer funds without action.To those considering using OFX, please be aware of the risk associated with this company. I am now seeking legal assistance to have the matter resolved.I expect OFX to take immediate responsibility, adhere to federal law on reversing unauthorized ACH debits, and return the funds promptly. If you're having similar issues, I urge you to speak up and hold them accountable.Stay cautious and informed. 👀#OFX #ConsumerRights #ACHDebit #UnresolvedFunds #CustomerService #Finance\n",
      "50. USELESS PLATFORMS WHEN COMPLETING KYC UNFORTUNATELY  ALWAYS SHOWING CLOSE WEBSITES AND SHOWING WEB NOT AVAILABLE REFRESH YOUR TO SHOW NEW CONTENTS\n",
      "51. Used OFX for basic payments ok. We then tried to contact them to discuss whether they can sync directly with Xero, and whether we could add another user who could set up the foreign exchange payments. Firstly, their team had terrible trouble simply understanding what we were asking and we had to clarify the simple request 5 times. Eventually they stopped responding and went silent. We switched to TorFX who responded immediately and can provide what we were asking for. OFX are not in the same league.Addendum in response to OFX reply. You have responded within 2hrs of us leaving this honest review. We tried for 4 weeks to get an answer before. So please do not patronise us by asking us to contact you to resolve it, we tried that and you failed to respond. Your ship with us has sailed and we are now with TorFX.\n",
      "52. The worst payment system I ever used.Sent 288 usd to a Peruvian USD bank account, 266 USD arrived. It took 3 working days to arrive, I had to manually transfer the money to their account which took another day. Remitly or Wise are twice as fast, you can pay with iDeal, and they are much more transparent and cheaper. Don’t waste your money, don’t use OFX!\n",
      "53. Hi, I have been trying for months to get my account sorted out so that I can buy/sell GBP & AUD. I have supplied my driver's licence with full address, my passport, my bank account showing full address etc etc. And yet my account is still not sorted out. I don't know what else I can do & it seems I will simply have to find someone else to do my trades through.So, to be honest, I am pretty unhappy with the service from OFX.RegardsPaul Fourie\n",
      "54. Lack of information up front regarding transfer status. no status update for processing times in the app regarding transfer delay.\n",
      "55. Horribly slow.  Still has not sent my money.  Don't have this issue with your competitors e.g.  Wise\n",
      "56. They blocked a $500 transfer to a single mother during Christmas because I had to prove I was not dealing drugs. I sent bank statements and social security info to 2 different banks and then and India Customer Service agent asked me to send banking information to a 3rd bank and I refused thinking fraud.  My transaction never went though and they isulted me every day.  the worst ever\n",
      "57. Confirmed transaction then without advising me, stopped the transfer of funds that I do every month.Second time this has happened..then asked me what I do with my money, where do I work. Absolutely ridiculous as I have furnished all information before and it's a monthly regular transfer all above board. We're not talking millions, we talking roughly £50 per month. A disgrace. When you call you get cut off and the staff are unhelpful. Official complaint not acknowledged. FCA review time.\n",
      "58. It's not that I don't want to communicate directly on the phone, but I called the Hong Kong hotline, but no one answered in English, Mandarin, or Cantonese, and I couldn't leave a message because the voice mailbox was full! What proof can Transfer 5E0D1237 provide that the money has been transferred? The Taiwan Bank reported the same today there is no remittance record received!There is no substantive content on the website or APP where I can check the destination of the remittance. It only wrote the day on which the remittance was made. Now there is no record of the payee at all.Please provide us with international proof, such as SWIFT MT103 so that we can trace the payment.\n",
      "59. I have used ofx service several times over the years. I closed the registered account several years ago, so I had to register a new bank account and was unable to because of your customer service/ compliance departments. Wanted  I won't use ofx.com again.\n",
      "60. Sent $2,300 CAD to UK Lloyd Bank.  Money disappeared and OFX wash their hands simply saying we have sent.  They gave me reference number to check with UK bank.  The number doesn't exists in UK bank - no trace.  No support from OFX.  Asked to return money and yet haven't received a positive answer.  Going to Court.  Do you want to send money through OFX after learning this?Update:After reading my review & concern, OFX replied saying that a Supervisor will call me.  Next morning I got the call and was lectured that my recipient is not doing correct thing and should go to bank again.  So instead of focusing on what OFX should do to correct the issue, OFX telling us what we should be doing and what we are not doing.  OFX asking to go to UK Lloyd Bank in person and nag for the money.  Is this how it work - you nag for money and bank give you money?  Is this called Accountability? Hah!\n",
      "61. This website is BEYOND confusing. If they want to be like any other bank or online currency system, they should have an automatic \"transfer to my bank account\" option and not \"transfer to recipient.\" This is mainly an issue for those who are signing up due to Faire's inability to transfer money through more friendly and well known USD to CAD conversion websites.My representative was no help and ignored my emails and linked me to youtube vidoes that were out of date. Their instructions led to me making a wire transfer instead of transferring to my CAD bank account. I was treated with a dismissive, rude man when I couldn't reach the 24/7 hotline 10 pm at night to cancel the transfer and had to call in the morning instead.Go elsewhere. This website has a poor layout and horrible customer service.\n",
      "62. Sent two transfers from NAB Melbourne to NAB Sydney which took far toooooo long to be cleared which caused me to miss a good rate for the third transfer…. I had to call customer services which sent me to the UK who was very helpful and within half an hour of speaking with Danny those first two transfers were cleared -   Missed the higher rate to send the third t’fer\n",
      "63. Very very slow too many messages for verification and a very confused staff\n",
      "64. I’ve been a customer for over ten years now. And normally OFX provides reliable, secure and fast exchange rate services.  But lately, I have trouble transacting and are asked to call.  And that’s where the trouble starts. No one answers the phone for more than 2.5 hours! Completely unacceptable since OFX, of course, is holding my funds for 5 days now. Time to look for someone with better customer service!  Hopefully, I’ll get my money back though…\n",
      "65. Terrible phone service. Have used OFX about 8 years back so called them this week to enquire about a forward fx contract on AUD300,000.Went through some security questions all fine and then told I was being transferred to dealing team. On hold for over 10minutes and nothing. Ended up hanging up.Tried again yesterday..... explained the above experience to the lady who went through security questions. She said she has \"checked the dealing queue\" and dealers will definitely answer this time as none else in the queue. Stayed on hold for 8 minutes and again, nothing.Will now be going elsewhere for my $300k trade.\n",
      "66. I usually get the money into Europe super fast, but this last time, it 'only' took 8 days !!! Why holding it for so long ? I thought you had banks in Europe ? Cannot do any business like that. First time disapointment. Business account is fast (2-3 days), private account is super slow. It should not be such a difference !\n",
      "67. shows a very attractive rate on the homepage, then you make an account and they are worse than competitors. then they cold call you and you tell them it’s misleading and they say it was a market fluctuation, yeah right in two minutes. gaslighting customers, lying, not trust worthy.Even in their reply they admit it’s misleading, displaying the live market rate in THEIR Calculator tool is MISLEADING. which is a rate you’ll never get no matter how much you transfer. XE and Transferwise offer way better rates. thanks for wasting my time\n",
      "68. Absolutely impossible customer service. I don't know if this company actually wants business--it's baffling to me. I have lots of money to move worldwide. I went through all of their verification procedures, none of it worked, even though I followed the email instructions. Called a few times for help and that ended up taking at a least a couple of hours. Overall, I've been doing this for almost two weeks. I sent the verification documents like they asked (they sent me an email for that), and then I just kept getting emails saying to complete one more step. I would avoid this company if you are serious about international money transfers. I asked them multiple times for help and got nowhere. By the way, OFX, if you actually read this, do not contact me. Your email has been blocked.\n",
      "69. I’ve been using OFX to send international transfers for my business for a year and the service has been excellent.  However it has been 25 days and counting for my most recent transaction of over $10, 000 and they have yet to pay the recipient and have not replied to my emails.  Completely unacceptable.\n",
      "70. generally good to work with - issue resoliution can be a challenge\n",
      "71. You loose 1.8% of your money if you use OFX instead of e.g. western Union or Panda Remittance. On top of that the recipient will not get what stated since an intermediate bank will charge another 0.15%. When you cancel a deal even though it's their fault you most likely will loose more money because of the reverse exchange rate they will then impose on you. There are much better providers out there. Don't use OFX\n",
      "72. Terrible customer service.Tried 6 times to call but no one ever picks up. call goes dead after 45mins.will never use again. basixally lost 500 GBP.\n",
      "73. I find the fund transfer takes too long They took money out of my bank and too 6 days to deposit to my other bankThis was a repetitive transfer and no reason for delay\n",
      "74. Reply from OFXOct 14, 2024Thank you for taking the time to write a review and provide feedback. We are sorry that you haven't had a positive experience with us, and would like the opportunity to discuss this in more detail. Could you please send us your OFX username to reviews@ofx com so we can look into this further for you?- OFXpert, SophieMy name is Chan Ye Pan, you can contact be at 65-93660165, or ypchan318@gmailcom\n",
      "75. Two Transfers didn’t go through and OFX wanted to charge me a fee. I will not use OFX for my future transfers.\n",
      "76. Very poor customer service and no proper update on transfer. Was to do a transfer, its been more than five working day, I submitted all document necessary and still the transfer has not been done and the money has been debited. Very very poor service and unreliable.\n",
      "77. Glad to know that after I commented on Facebook about my money not delivered to the recipient over a month ago, OFX stepped in to fix the issue promptly by returning money, but I’m disappointed that the refund is not the whole refund. I got penalized for $47.14 which isn’t my fault.This is another way of gouging customers. I paid $1000 plus $15 transfer fee to begin with. The control of banking fee you mentioned is totally not acceptable. I should have got the full amount back. No more services with this company not capable to fulfill their service to the customer.\n",
      "78. I sent an email with proof of payment of an amount to be sent the the US.  I detailed all the emails I had with dates.  I have had no confirmation of the amount being sent nor has the website been updated to show that it has been sent.  I am disappointed that I cannot seem to get this resolved after quite a time of asking.Since this review I have spoken with OFX and I have been able to discuss the issue.\n",
      "79. I've had many successful transfers for 10+ years with OFX and only experienced one very delayed transfer. OFX has taken my feedback on board and also provided me with assistance for next time.\n",
      "80. I understand basic protocol to prevent money laundering etc but OFX have made it laborious and unnecessarily complicated to make an oversees payment to a Pastor who'd be officiating our wedding. I'd gone above and beyond their requests even giving the contact details of the Pastor for them to make contact but now they've delayed the payment to him but processed our other payments in preparation for our Wedding abroad and we've now had our plans pushed back. OFX had stipulations they wanted addressed but forget to mention this to me the customer, who's using their service of a money transfer. They did not make their further stipulations known to me for me to meet them and have my money transferred as it should of been. I had to chase OFX down, to then be told they wanted further information before releasing payment, but they've never mentioned this at any stage of my joining up with them.\n",
      "81. We’ve used Ofx over the years successfully, but have found our current transfer to be a complete nightmare. We initially called pre transfer and customer service guy took note of the transaction amount, but provided no help or advice of requirements. When transfer was booked no guidance was provided on compliance requirements, and when these arrived they had no relation to the source of funds which the first call advised Ofx of. When we called to clarify the requirements Ofx agreed that their ask (proof of employment) was misplaced as it had no relation to source of funds, but it seems that nothing happened to change their requirements and documentation didn’t go to compliance team until their original requirements were met. 6 days later no funds as it’s sitting with ‘compliance’ with no communication. Will call again today, but this is not the customer service we saw in the past.We are a week plus since funds we’re transferred to Ofx and are stuck with no update and no €€.Updating 25th:- after initial documents were provided 6 days ago Ofx today requested basic ID and address confirmation today, which again could easily have been provided last week. This sits even outside of their own compliance team SLAs of two days.Further update 27th:- No update from Ofx on transfer and on calling again update is ‘it’s with compliance’.  Formal complaint hasn’t illicit a response either, nor has emailing the email address below. Seem like no one is home. We are 9 days now since funds have been transferred and can’t seem to get any answers.AVOID.\n",
      "82. After a period with excellent service i sent money via OFX to Vietnam and it was a total disaster. After asking for a host of anti money laundering documents, nothing happened for a week, and with the payment being urgent, i had to make it by an alternative method, since they were not at all able to guarantee that my money would ever arrive at its destination (a travel agent). When i asked for the money to be returned, they asked for a screenshot of my money leaving my account, and this after having sent me confirmation that the funds had reached them a week earlier. How Mickey Mouse is that. Really, the world upside down, and the whole experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth.\n",
      "83. Representative accidentally emailed me a different customer’s name, address, and full account number.Team did not seem panicked: got not reply to a customer support ticket. Eventually talked to her manager who assured me the rep would continue to be trained on best practices. I felt my data (and my money!) was not secure. Do not recommend.\n",
      "84. First of all, they are 'now open 24/7' but when you call you get put on hold, with a message saying over and over again 'leave your number and we will call you back'  well I did that no less that THREE times and never got a call back.  Then 2 days ago I was told the money which I had transferred from Canada would be in my account yesterday, but it wasn't.  So when I finally reached someone (after waiting on hold for about a half hour) I was told that she had been mistaken (told me that Monday was a holiday, as if I didn't know), and that I would receive it today.  Well  today I got an email saying the funds had been forwarded to my bank and my bank should receive them within 1-3 business days.  It's already been over a week, really unacceptable.\n",
      "85. Service was good but disappointed that my currency rate for Aust $ was better with SCB. Also my last transaction as of this morning was still not credited to my Aust account. SCB transaction took 1 business day OFX takes longer it seems\n",
      "86. The last transfer was delayed more than 24 hours. This is my first delay experience\n",
      "87. Took too long to answer phone. Also, usually you give competitive rates - this time I was given UK £70-125 less in my exchange from AUD than XE.com for example. You wouldn’t even match it? I went with you as I didn’t have time to register with another provider. But will go to another next week.\n",
      "88. Stay away from this company. I’ve had a terrible ongoing experience with them. On August 20th, 2024, I initiated a transfer to my wife, and as of today, September 3rd, 2024, the funds have still not been received in the beneficiary account. Initially, they claimed that the intermediary bank was holding the funds for sanctions checks. Then, on August 28, they informed me that the bank had released the hold and was processing the payment. However, the funds have yet to be received. Despite my continuous follow-ups, they have only provided vague and nonsensical responses, such as stating that the bank is on holiday and we can't provide timeline for resolution. I plan to file a complaint with the authorities.*Update: as of today 4 September, OFX has returned the funds to my OFX account and now processing a new deal of transfer. Customer service is not good especially Ihab Mohsan does not provide accurate information.I truly believe they impose these tricks to delay payment and generate revenue out of funds. Avoid!\n",
      "89. I used OFX 2 years ago and really enjoyed the experience. This time was more of a hassle and caused more stress than necessary.I had used the same bank account previously, using the same verification processes with no issue. This time around it felt like I was not being accepted for non-valid reasons. After stressing multiple times that this bank account has been verified in another OFX account, then things started to move along. Then it took only 1 day to organise, whereas before this, it wa nearly 7-10 days before I had any help. Lily was understanding and really pushed the issue and I thank them for that.Compliance need to have their own line to explain the issue, since \"talking to compliance\" did not do anything except impede the process.\n",
      "90. OFX is a total scam. They misuse your information so don't trust this platform. Also, their customer support is very very unprofessional. They will keep asking you for your personal data unnecessarily and misuse it. It's better to use Wise as it is way more convenient and credible.\n",
      "91. Deposits vs withdrawals are getting further and further apart...NOT SATISFACTORY....slippage for your end.\n",
      "92. OFX HOLDING MY FUNDS BEWARE!!!I created my OFX account last month after all the verification the account was fully verified and we started using it for our business operations. We were getting all payments in our account as soon as I tried to make a transfer our account showing a verification requirement.This error came after the account was active for almost a month and after we have received around 15 payments from Stripe. We run a very simple eCommerce business.When I clicked to complete the verification, it showed nothing and all it did was refreshed the page. I contacted our account manager and asked her what's going on. She said will work with internal team to get this fixed.She got back to me and said I need to provide address verification proof. This was so strange since we already did the address verification before the account was approved. After a lot of back and forth the address verification was approved and then she told me now the team wants to see if we have any agreement with the company we are paying.We hired a marketing company for our ecommerce brand and showed them the contract. Told her if they have any issues they can just cancel the transfer.She told us that the team is reviewing the agreement and will update soon. I keep following her on this issue and still there is no update.She keep saying team is working on this and even she is frustrated now.It has been OVER A MONTH NOW AND NO UPDATE!!She told me she even contact the Vice President and they keep telling her we are working.All our funds are stuck and team won't respond.WHY WOULD YOU APPROVE ACCOUNT AND THEN HOLD MONEY!!!BEWARE AND DON\"T TRUST!!\n",
      "93. The two staff I talked to were excellent, your quoted online rates less so initially causing OFX to lose business. Two staff I dealt with, one for account enquiries making me aware of better rates available if I call involving large amounts and the other to obtain a better exchange rate than quoted online.I had already made $100k of trades with Wise as your online rates quoted now seem aimed at slightly  beating the major banks and not other online exchange companies. Online rate improved by 1.6c NZ equivalent to Wise online rate.\n",
      "94. Transfer was slower than expected. Rate was wider than expected.\n",
      "95. This was one of the worst--if not the worst--experiences I have ever had with a firm on the internet.  I wanted to transfer 1000 Euro to a friend in Palestine.  The process involved seven or eight different emails, each from a different person, which is understandable given the nature of your service, but I didn't feel I was being dealt with personally and that the people were not always connecting the emails.  Only after OFX received the money, was I asked for \"supporting information,\" after which I heard nothing for several days  When I finally asked how much longer I had to wait, I received an telephone call from the \"Middle Office\" in which the lady said my application had been rejected, and that I should send verification that I had paid the amount (which I had already sent earlier as part of the supporting information, but had to send again because of the lack of communication in the firm). I was never given an acceptable reason for the rejection, and the whole procedure was impersonal and robot-like.Dr. Barron Holland\n",
      "96. Not impressed so far. I am new to OFX but it is the worst payment system I have used so far. Transferwise and Paypal are so much better and easier to use.Unfortunately, depending on the company or the country, you are transferring to, these service are not always available.So far my payments are far too slow, I have to wait far too long and I don't even know when my payments have been recieved.\n",
      "97. Payment went through pretty timely, but whatever happened to the free transfers? $15 to transfer $200 (+ mark up on the exchange rate) feels like a rip off. Will look to other providers in future, but I was set up and need to pay quickly without having to go into a bank.\n",
      "98. I sent money from Australia to the UK with these guys 5 days ago.  After following them up I was promised it would be in my account that afternoon.  Still hasn’t arrived.  Use someone else\n",
      "99. Two-factor authentication continues to prevent website use of OFX. I have only a dumb-phone. The man I phoned in Calif. was extremely helpful and got the job done fast.\n",
      "100. Update: 2/3 of missing transfers going back a month still not resolved and no sign of my money. Engaging with the boss of the manager still yields no results. All they do is blame the banks.Update 2OFX have lost three of my paymentsSpeaking to the London manager has resulted nothing - her boss is 'not in the office and still has not called ad promised. All I hear are excuses. 3 weeks now since the transaction was done and I still do not have my money.OFX have lost three of my exchanges.Two weeks later, I'm still having to call and chase Manager who still has not called me back despite being promised a call back. Who's in charge??? Help desk constantly gives the same response 'it's being investigated' yet not one person has taken responsibility.\n",
      "101. When I was setting up the app I made a mistake by putting an amount in, which I didn’t realise, until I got a nasty email about not following through on the transfer 😳🤷🏻‍♀️.I emailed my explanation, so everything is alright now, but………\n",
      "102. 80k EUROI made a first transfer with this site, a rather large amount, unfortunately the money has been with them for 1 week without any credible explanation, they asked for all kinds of documents, including the photo of the recipient's passport, which I have sent but as far as I know it is forbidden to ask for the documents of another person except the one who holds the accountAt this moment they are simply wasting time, I am starting to become skeptical that something good will happen, these people should simply be locked up with their license revoked, I think they are investing the money they receive, unfortunately I don't see another explanationIf you use this site, think twice before, I sent the money 10 days ago, they received it 8 days ago and since then they have been asking for documents continuously. In the last 2 days they keep telling to wait, I think they invested the money and lost it, now they are waiting for another transfer, a shame\n",
      "103. Initial verification asked for my passport.   Okay, a passport is a good method to verify.   Employers use this since the US government has already verified identity and vetted prior to getting a passport.Then a video.   Okay, I can see this to make sure I actually am the person in the passport photo.Next they ask for the SSAN.   TOTAL B*LLSH*T!!!!!  I have to provide my SSAN to get a passport, so I'm already verified.  OFX DOES NOT NEED THAT to make a transfer.I will be providing my bank account information for doing a transfer.So, you want my passport, my bank account information and my ssan.   Every piece of information an identity thief would need!  My ID (passport), my address (from the passport), my bank account information and my ssan.  Identity thief's dream!  Whether you intend anything nefarious or not, if you are ever hacked, then I'm screwed.As someone else said, prepare for a colonoscopy.  You can claim it's for security, but for transferring money, you do not need the SSAN to verify me.  The passport process has ALREADY done that.There's security and then there's idiocy.   OFX crosses the idiocy line.Edit:   In their reply, they say they must have this because it's a highly regulated industry/business and to \"facilitate\" transfers.   Nice try, but other companies can make a transfer without subjecting people to PII abuse.  But, not OFX.  To transfer money, the banking information of the sender and the banking information of the receiver is needed to \"facilitate\" a transfer.\n",
      "104. 5 days to clear. Multiple emails, calls and screenshots. Total waste of time. Never use again\n",
      "105. I've been using OFX for several years as I had been living overseas for the better par of two decades. I have a long history of making foreign transactions. It seems that every time I login there are new obstacles and security requirements that just create more roadblocks and chew up my valuable time. I needed additional security clearance for my latest transaction. My ID details were required. I submitted them 5 times, with nobody being able to tell me what was wrong until the last submission - and it was never acknowledged in writing.My emergency passport (expiring at the end of this year) that I am able to use to travel to and from the USA was not acceptable to pay for my children's tuition fees in Australia. This is unacceptable. It was unnecessary. I will not be using OFX again. If I could have rated this with no stars, I would have, as nothing is what I was able to accomplish with OFX.\n",
      "106. I wanted to find out if OFX was cheaper to use than WISE.  Sadly I did not. Unfortunately, I answered too many personal details in the application process that I put myself and my personal information at risk.There is always a danger that a website will be hacked but the level of detail that OFX collects such as date of birth, social security number, address and full legal name is all a scammer needs to cause extreme mischief. Perhaps OFX data will never be compromised. But, when they are, their customers will be in trouble.\n",
      "107. While I have used OFX before and have  been satisfied, my most recent transaction was routed through and intermediary which deducted a noticeable amount.  Given I only transferred a relatively small son, the impact on the recipient was inconvenient.\n",
      "108. Totally disgraceful company . Would not even give one star . Customer service is shocking argumentative and incompetent.  Would definitely never use them . Stay clear\n",
      "109. your compliance dept has requested I speak with a Mr Hayes, who supposedly is on the job 24 hours per day 7 days per week.I have caled OFX 5 times in the last week to speak with him and no one has even picked up the phone. Obviously mor help is required\n",
      "110. I sent money from Canada to USA to my brother due to emergency. As they claimed to send it within 3 business days I ended up choosing ofx. Unfortunately my brother didn't receive the money past a week. So I called them to inform the issue. I am an international student in Canada and my brother is also an international student. Spending 265$ is not easy for us. We work hard to earn it. Anyways, I called ofx customer service and they said the money is yet to be transferred which really made me anxious. So after talking to them I decided to cancel my transaction cause I already send the money via Remitly which is way more effective. They promised me to send my money back by the next day. It has been 1 month and I haven't received my money. I called and they as usual apologize and say that they will return it to me in 1 business day. They even take 15$ exchange fee for the transfer, which isn’t informed earlier. I believe this ofx thing is a scam.\n",
      "111. We ordered a transfer of 500 CZK to book a room in a lodgement of the Czech Republik and the receptor received 200 CZK. They work with intermediate third parties that charge abusive hidden fees. Definitely not recommended.\n",
      "112. I created an account and initiated a transfer on June 17th. I had to then spend the next week speaking to about seven different agents on the phone and sending all sorts of private documents, including a photocopy of the ID of my recipient. I received two calls during this period telling me the transfer would go through and it did not. They withdrew the funds from my American bank account and held it hostage for a week. After being exhausted I had to cancel the transfer, they agreed and returned it by WIRE transfer yesterday which cost me $15.00! haha In the end, I paid $15 for them to take and hold my money for a week and whilst giving them private information that they now have in perpetuity. Do not use them, find any other company.\n",
      "113. Easy to use but deceptive with the rate .When you go online for the exchange rate they tell you a higher one to suck you in , but when you go into your account to do the exchange it is always much lower .They will say we displayed the wholesale rate , but when you are looking at the rate they know you are not a wholesaler !\n",
      "114. Have been waiting for 2 weeks for money transfer from Canada - Panama, despite advertising 3-5 days.  First week went by, nothing.  We called, they asked for paperwork which we had sent in day one, but it was clearly overlooked or missed.   Sent paperwork in AGAIN.  Week two, silence.  Called 3 times in last two days, on hold for 15-30.  Each time we were promised a call back, but all we got was silence.  Still working on it !    If you are need money fast, think twice, we hear WISE is the way to go.\n",
      "115. The process went really well & I was informed my transfer went through.        HOWEVER, I then get a phone call telling me ozforex was canceling my order & then proceeded to take my money out of my account, full well knowing ozforex had already canceled my order. So now ozforex has my money for several days before they put it back into my original account.\n",
      "116. I can use other businesses to send money in 10 minutes.. you take ten days!  Sorry, never again!!\n",
      "117. I've complained about this company several times and every time they response saying 'it's unusual'.  Well it's not.  I've been on hold so far 37 minutes and counting.  I'm still waiting to get through to someone - but each time this happens I just leave another bad review for them - hopefully when it costs them customers they will do the right thing and employ staff that can answer a phone. The good thing about this company though is that at least it's not overseas people that answer and they are actually Australian's or English and very well mannered and nice people to deal with. They also have terrible internal processes, my Direct Debits often don't get triggered resulting in my clients getting very upset and me having to chase things up.  This company could be so good, and they used to be, but they just seem to keep dropping the ball and it's a shame as they are nice people.\n",
      "118. Customer service or customer hindrance?I was hustled into making a transfer and then threatened with a fee for cancellation.\n",
      "119. I have been a client for 20 years and previously they have been good, however without notice they froze my account because of compliance - when I came to use the account - what did they need ? A bank statement and my employment status.  I phoned and waited 31 minutes to be told this!!I provided this and with the information that  I would be notified in 40 hours - I called back waited another 25 minutes and was told it was with complianceAfter 5 days   !!!- 4 phone calls including  one with a supervisor who promised she would call me back within a couple of hours after speaking with Compliance -and didn’t , I called again after 3 hours after another long wait spoke to a man who couldn’t put me through to the supervisor but managed to speak with her and he told me he could do a transaction over the phone - which I did, for the last time.  I asked him to request the supervisor to call me which after 1 hour she hasn’t.OFX used to be fantastic, responsive and used commonsense - that has all gone and been replaced by people who act and talk like machines “ I am sorry to hear that “.  Etc etc just BSI asked for a better rate to recognise my long waits on the phone and general lack of communication by OFX - The computer says No !No more OFX,I would advise seeking an alternative to this ramshackle bunch of people- if they are and not machines\n",
      "120. Dreadful time-wasting experience trying to set up an account.  Spent many hours in a queue on expensive telephone call to  the OFX 24 hr number, waiting for someone to pick up the phone.  Never did get my query addressed.  Just awful.\n",
      "121. This company has changed......badly. I was a customer of OFX for the last 6 years. I would do irregular transfers back to Australia when the exchange rate was favorable or to pay bills when I needed to. A couple of days ago, they blocked my account when I tried to make a small transfer to pay my accountant $300. They requested to know how many transfers I would be making, value of each transfer, minimum and maximum transfer amounts, purpose of each transfer.I told the rep that my transfer are irregular and will not be for consistent amounts. They proceeded to then state that they can no longer provide services. No problem.....I will continue to use Wise....a much better company to deal with.\n",
      "122. I placed a trade on June 11th, £50 birthday gift in Rand to my niece in SA.The deal was blocked by OFX for 'security reasons'. I phoned June 12th and was told it would be unblocked, here I am on June 13th and told it's with their 'compliance team' and will take 24-48 hours to review, what an absolute joke. I've been a customer for over 10 years and noticed a deterioration in transfers over the past 12 months. Something has gone wrong within OFX, I will NEVER use them again, there are other traders more efficient.Very disappointed ex-customer.Mr Morgan, Wales\n",
      "123. Compliance team can't seem to read... Told \"Your OFX Account is ready to go\" then asked to submit documents. Two weeks into the process and nothing to show for it. I did, however, manage to set up an account with wise, and send crucial international business payments in 48 hours.\n",
      "124. Very very bad service  never will use it. For just 10 pounds it took ages\n",
      "125. Had my account under a week. For making a $1200 transfer to Italy I had to strip completly naked. Back with WIZE now wich is a great company. Can`t recommend OFX at all!\n",
      "126. You have the best customer support team in the business, but the fact that it takes 4 business days for a USD/MXN transaction to be cleared, while there are other companies like Felix that takes seconds, it is going to take clients away from you. You need to find a way to be faster.\n",
      "127. OFX failed to process the transfer,and after 9 days of waiting , and follow up,the ended up returning the amount to my bank account with 919$ deduction,No answer , no response and no what so ever a logic with their act!\n",
      "128. OFX has lost my transfer from Canada to Mexico and it's $1,025,000 US Dollars!This has been going on for at least a month.Is the money stuck at OFX's Bank of New York?How do I get a copy of the wire transfer to trace?Should I ask for a copy or request of an MT103?This is horrible!Horrible customer service and lack of follow up..a million dollars..just disappeared!!!\n",
      "129. I must say this is the worst service I've ever seentwo weeks of emails,calls and documentsHello Majed we need your companys documents, here you go, we need invoices, here you go, we need your bank statements, sure! oh we need to verify its you, OK, do you have some proof that you receive money from country X, yes I do here you go mate..after 2 weeks, of giving all the documents, they say that they cannot open an account for me, and to make things even worse, they cant tell me whyPathetic service, unprofessional customer service, unethical bank that now has all my personal and business information for nothing\n",
      "130. i wan to login  OFX account but i can't log incountry government development project audit analysis salary savings account and exchange getaway globally service #LLC #UK #AU #BD $$$$$\n",
      "131. Good rates but very slow giving the impression they’re working with my money in between…their compliance is difficult and processing takes days then the transfer 4 daysNo comparison to Remitly (within 1 hour transfer) or wise (1 day) but the rates are far worse\n",
      "132. Do not trust them. Shower of incompetent muppets. Tried to transfer money to Saudi and had more phone calls with these people than any other service I have used. Do not trust them\n",
      "133. Update 31 May 2024:OFX reached out and returned the money.Original Post:Like others have mentioned OFX can suddenly withhold your money and not respond to your emails. In my case the amount isn’t too big as compared others here. It’s just $1500 and I was transferring it between my bank accounts. OFX came up with a novel pretext of asking fathers name and they won’t transfer or return the money unless I divulge more personal details. Other money transfer companies don’t ask for such details. Don’t trust this company with any of your private information or money. You’ll lose both. How was my account approved by OFX? Why the transfer accepted in the first place ? How is this company still in business ? Why don’t the authorities shut it down ? What a scam. Although only a week has passed (since 15 May 2024) but going by the other reviews I won’t be seeing $1500 returned anytime soon. Request everyone here to also file complaints with their in country regulators.\n",
      "134. I sent OFX $9200 and they closed my account and refused to do the transfer, despite being a long time customer of theirs. The agent in the San Francisco office refused put me in touch with a manager nor did she agree to have a manager call me back. The agent lacked empathy and had no flexibility. There was no escalation process nor a way to lodge a formal complaint. Now they are holding my money and I cannot get it back. Beware before sending money to the company. You may save a little in the short term but if there is anything that goes wrong, good luck getting your money back.Edit: two months have passed since OFX replied to my review and the issue has not been resolved and they are still holding my money. Stay away from this company!\n",
      "135. I wouldn't recommend using them. I initiated my transfer 11 days ago, still not response from support as to what is happening - I could have traveled to the country and dropped the money off myself, quicker than they respond. By the time this transfer has completed, I wont need it. At this moment in time, I am doubtful to whether I will be returned my funds.I will update this review if any progress is made.\n",
      "136. OFX allowed me to book a transfer and they received my funds. They subsequently cancelled the transaction and kept my funds. I have reached out many times to conflicting advice. They advised they would call back and did not. They then advised the account was still under review. They still have my funds. Would not recommend this service.I emailed the below reference and they asked me to call again, quite comical. Many hours trying to get through and no one answers. They are still holding $75k of my funds. I am truly perplexed as to how this 'company' is still in business.\n",
      "137. No full disclosure of conditions to transfer funds, once they have your money they then ask questions and delay release of MY MONEY!!

As stated in the transfer and OFX took all my information and agreed to open an account... I agreed, OFX agreed... or maybe not... we need more... Urgent action required we cant send YOUR MONEY because we want to know more information about youMy bank to bank transfer as I would normally use transferred the funds in under 6 hours ..I relied on a recommendation to use OFX, I won't be recommending them.OFX tried to block my review.....Next time you dont like something OFX web moderators, how about fix the business, stop using fine print to circumvent privacy Act regulations which you clearly have and try to hide behind anti money laundering requirements... its an overreach too many businesses in the financial sector use these daysAs a positive once I asked for my funds to be returned and providing proof that I'd paid those funds, even though your system acknowledged that funds had been received, they were returned in full, not one cent missing the next dayNot convinced, search for low ratings of OFX, I am not alone and who knows how many they have successfully blocked because OFX didnt like it...Thank you Trustpilot for keeping customers experiences transparent\n",
      "138. Hi Nisha, I am in communication with an OFX representative to resolve this matter. Therefore, I will email you when I have received my response and additionally update this thread. Thanks.\n",
      "139. Been dealing with this company for years and always impressed by their knowledge and speed.  This time however, I paid the GBP on the 26 April and today 6 May have still not received the funds.  When I first queried the delay was told I had to send a statement in. No one told me that my transfer was dependent on this.  Had the form required about a month ago been correctly formulated, all would have been ok but I guess the progammers did not get that other countries have a different amount of numbers so my form was constantly rejected.  However, I sent the bank statement five days ago and still zero.  Worse, I have been holding on the phone for 1.5 hours and no one responds.  Disgrace.now it is the 9th and still no money and the 'phone remains unanswered!!!\n",
      "140. *Updated* 3 weeks for a transfer to complete. Ensure your KYC records are up-to-date before moving any money.  Really OFX should ensure this is done periodically and BEFORE accepting trades but they don't which delayed my transfer.\n",
      "141. Paid money to a company in South Africa for outdoor equipment but because the word \"hunting\" is part of their name my transaction was declined by OFX.  It took them more than 2 week to inform me and meantime I am under the impression that the company received the payment.  I will never use this company again as customer service was poor and I am still waiting for my money.\n",
      "142. Worst experience with payment processing I’ve had. I started my account with them in hopes for paying the employees overseas but it took me 3 weeks just to start an account. The compliance team does a thorough check which I don’t have a problem with but after I send one document, they kept asking for more with every email thread instead of one single time asking for all. After the three weeks on having my account approved. I started using it finally, sent 6 payments to my employees, first, it said 1-2 business day but at this point, it’s been about 5 business days and my employees still haven’t received the payment. I tried calling their support and they all say the same thing(it’s still processing)Some other points to note:-- My account randomly stopped working in the middle of doing payroll after sending the salary to half of my employees- Their exchange rate is probably the worst I’ve seen in the undustry.\n",
      "143. Sent 6000 HKD, OFX says they didn't receive it. I tried calling customer service just to be on hold for 3 hours. Horrible service, don't trust the 5 star reviews, search their addresses up, it doesn't exist.\n",
      "144. I liked your rates and luckly for me I got help from Sonia who helped me with my transactionFound difficulties with the system, I guess my first time using this service\n",
      "145. Absolute rubbish. For '£35' transfer they held the money, asked for the source of funding, bank statement, reason for transfer etc. 10 days later eventually the money was transferred. Don't use them if you don't want to waste your time. Absolute waste of time... Don't use them. Use a proper company instead and save yourselves lots of headache and unnecessary phone calls to chase your money...\n",
      "146. I found tht it took too long for funds to actually get to the designated recipient.\n",
      "147. Several online changes or updates to your profile are not allowed online and need to be handled by calling their customer service phone number. Fine, but on a recent service request I stayed on the phone for more than 30 minutes without being helped. Not impressive.\n",
      "148. They use to be very good, but have gone down hill rapidly\n",
      "149. Before OFX took over FIRMA, there was no charge for ACH transfers.  Now there is a $25 charge per transaction.\n",
      "150. Started the registration process whilst looking for a platform to undertake overseas supplier payments for a lower fee - quickly realised this was not suitable for my specific purpose so did not continue with the registration. However I continued to get spammed with calls and emails, every day even AFTER sending an email requesting the registration process be cancelled and my information wiped from the system. I had a very blunt email back stating my account has been closed, but I'm still getting voicemails left by this company. I have blocked their email & number since. Not sure why the company thinks harassing potential clients is good practice.\n",
      "151. I used OFX because I have previously found it to be far cheaper than card payment despite it being much more difficult .A transfer of £720 cost $1406.Had I used my mastercard debit it would have cost me $1399.Will check first next time!!\n",
      "152. OFX failed to return my morning call. Needed info to make international transfer.  Made 2nd call at 1610 and again failed to get through- not acceptable.  Martin Barnett 01672 569231\n",
      "153. Really frustrating experience… I tried to call the customer support regarding a transaction verification but no success. And looks like they will cancel my deal soon. At the same time, I keep receiving emails from them stating that they can’t reach me. What a mess!\n",
      "154. Kept my money on hold and customer service keeps having to verify and they keep delaying and they’re keeping my money. Absolutely disgusting do not work with them\n",
      "155. I recently closed my account  due to questioning on a transaction that already had stated purpose. Asking personal questions that felt over the top. I shall use another company after many years and many large transactions.\n",
      "156. I had organised a fund transfer on 3rd of April, got a confirmation of funds received by OFX the same day, and 9 days later still no funds in the third party's account.Aran from customer service promised me on 9th of April that the funds would be in the recipient's account the same day, which didn't happen.I received an email from Nazneen, client associate, that the compliance team would look into it. I've heard nothing since. 9 days of funds being stuck in limbo in these times of cost-of-living crisis and recession is irresponsible!\n",
      "157. The transfer was stuck for nearly two weeks with no explanation. A trivial amount between existing personal accounts, have done this countless times without problems.Complete waste of time. Not sure what's going on with OFX, they've always been a bit slow, but this is ridiculous. Zero updates or notifications.Never again, bye.To their credit, they did cancel the transaction shortly after it was requested via email.\n",
      "158. I have started an account with them 2 weeks ago and they keep \"verifying my account\". The Customer Support is horrible, they called me 2 times then my issue it's thrown to the bin. If I don't write them or call them, they do absolutely nothing. For a service that deals with money transfer, they have the worst service. DO NOT USE if you have other option. DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR MONEY, if they can't even have an account made right.\n",
      "159. Consistently incompetent. Unbelievable delays, zero ability to see incoming funds of current balance. Lost funds, missed transfers, duplicate transfers... how did this company manage to pass financial accreditation? Run, don't walk, from this company.\n",
      "160. Taking for ever to send funds.\n",

The company operates in New Zealand business hours, apart from the support staff who are 24/7 but are unable to approve/enact decisions.Had an issue with a remit at 8:30am, sent required documents five minutes later, the compliance team didnt look at the documents  for another 24 hours while the remittance was on hold. I wasnt informed the remittance was on hold. after 24 hours more documentation was requested instead of all documents beng requested at the same time, took another 24 hours for my response to be looked at while the remittance was still being held. Documentation requested was for a marriage certificate or joint tenancy agreement to prove  my relationship with one of my recipients, the presumption being that the only reason i would remit overseas was if i was married to or tenanting with a recipient. At the very same time i sent all the requested documents i was told the documents i had sent, which had yet to be looked at were no good, my account was suspended and remains inactive despite being a customer for 4 years + and despite providing my source of funds, employment and verified ID of recipients. The support team/customer service is awesome, the compliance team are horrendous, lazy & incompetent and there incompetence & inaction left my recipient incredibly stressed and in the lurch due to not receiving the remittance she needed for medical costs.\n",

      "9. I hope you can solve the problem of your other bank partners in the Philippines, to speed up the processing of the money sent so that it can be received immediately, if possible on the day of sending, it can be received immediately on the same day.

I always experience this issue every time I make transfer to Philippines for money pickup.Thank you.\n",

She shouldnt be jumping into conclusion, she could have ask me did you remember if you have met the cap of your gcash amount. Very bad customer service\n",

      "23. I was surprised because it was so quick to send the money, so I was happy about that. But when I had to enter which bank card the money would be deducted from, it didn't go so well until the third time and there was money in all the accounts, so I didn't understand why.\n",
      "24. I tried to send $100 and found out my personal email was already registered on Remitly. After spending over 30 minutes in chat with support (first agent: Xyra Mae Joy), I was asked to send my ID and personal information to service remitly.com. Once I did that, I was transferred to another agent, Karlfried, who simply told me to call customer support directly.Why was I asked to send personal documents if the final answer was just \"call us\"? This was a complete waste of time and a terrible customer experience. I felt like my personal information was mishandled and I still have no solution. Extremely disappointing.Date of experience: 23/07/2025\n",

      "26. I was checking the exchange rate on other sites and it was higher by 40 cents with only 4 dollars more for transaction\n",
      "27. Simple transaction for $30 for McDonald's sent to my fiance and kids got paused. Took forever to get it resolved. Several other transactions for larger amounts have gone through fine. Why flag The smallest transaction. Had to re-verify my information 2 times before it was processed keep me awake the first time and called and woke me up the 2nd time. I would gladly let $30 go for my missed sleep.\n",
      "28. Love the fact that I can send money easily, however make sure everything is correct 100% before going to the next page. Sent money to a friend, and because I fat fingered 1 number, I am out $200! Asked for help with it, and was told that isn't their problem!There isn't a verification step to ensure everything is put in properly, and I truly feel that would be the way to go. Otherwise just seems like bad form, or lazy coding; your choice on which!\n",
      "29. Suspended my account. Support said account not eligible for reinstatement due to policy violation issues. Yet they can’t state what policy was violated\n",
      "30. Very bad experience\n",
      "31. The money wasn’t available until next day\n",
      "32. I have been waiting for my money back (2000 usd)  for almost a month. I’m tired of waiting and hearing excuses and having to tell them about my case over and over again just because I want my money back and they don’t do the proper effort to solve this problem.\n",
      "33. We were using it for some time and had a good experience. But, we made some mistakes in one of the transactions. Then we understand, only in failure do you see what was truly broken. We are still after them to get the transaction done, its more than a month.\n",
      "34. Too much time for the delivery put the money. It’s a lot of questions. What is the money you go from? What are you going? Just not good.\n",
      "35. I've had an increasingly frustrating experience with Remitly that I feel compelled to share. It’s not just my account—my partner’s and a friend’s accounts have also been suspended, seemingly without proper cause or consistent reasoning. That alone raises serious concerns about how Remitly handles user accounts.Secondly, they made me do a 30-minute interview explaining each of my expenses before suspending the account. And all of my expenses were  legal, legitimate, and for personal or family use. It felt excessive and invasive, especially considering there was no indication I had violated any terms.The final and most troubling issue is that once an account is suspended, you lose access to your past transaction history. In my case, I needed the recipient information from a large payment I made—specifically for a vehicle purchase—but Remitly won’t allow me to log in to retrieve that data. Their email receipts don’t include full details, which effectively locks me out of important financial records I should have access to.I would not recommend Remitly to anyone due to the lack of transparency and poor customer service.\n",
      "36. Worst!!hidden charges\n",
      "37. I have used Remitly without issue for almost 2 years.  I have had some transfers stopped, but normally after I spoke with them on the phone they would be able to repair the transfer.  Now, they have just cancelled my account and refused a transfer.  They keep telling me policies and such, but I cannot understand why after 2 years they suddenly have policies that prevent me from sending money to myself from myself.\n",
      "38. Money is receiving past but pay lower rate compare to other exchanges\n",
      "39. Fees are too high - takes hours and hours for money to be transferred.. I understand there are checks etc but takes agesFees too much\n",
      "40. Its easy to use, However I do NOT like that I cannot leave a memo for what the payment is for.  This makes it difficult.\n",
      "41. Remitly offers good exchange rates, which is great for getting more value while sending money abroad. However, the transaction fee is fixed at £1.99, regardless of the amount. This makes it worthwhile only for larger transfers, but not ideal for people sending small amounts, as the fee stays the same.Another issue is the transfer time—it can be slightly longer than expected. So, if someone is looking for an instant transfer, they might be disappointed.Overall, it’s a decent service for larger transactions, but not the best choice for quick or low-value transfers.\n",
      "42. There's a payment apparently under way but cannot be completed\n",
      "43. I have done many transactions through remitly and introduce many customers to them. They used to have very good service and one of my friend already told me thr service gone down they are delaying. I give them margin that it happens some times. Few month's back, then it happens with me and then after few days i have received refund. Now i have sent money on 18th july instant (Less Rate) and they kept saying issues with recipient bank then weekend has started. Now they said then have contacted recipient bank and they will send money shortly. It supposed to reach in seconds and recipient bank is replying them but not sending money? This is my last transaction with them. Bye bye Remitly\n",
      "44. Suspending my account for sending money to the same person\n",
      "45. I am very disappointed with Remits I had enough time using it and they stole. I just want my money back. they should put alerts when you are going to make the shipments I hope you return my money\n",
      "46. Using fast payment to Remitly, I attempted to transfer some money abroad. The transfer was refused for no obvious reason. I tried one more time. Again, the request was cancelled but both times the money Remitly had received from me through bank payments, they kept it. It is more than two weeks now, I have requested several times since, but their office is not very organised. They admit money received but do not return it to me.\n",
      "47. I do not like the way you charge your fees, that is all . lol\n",
      "48. Money takes too long and does not go direct to mobile money.\n",
      "49. Very bad serviceMy first and last mistakeThey are making the things complicated and taking very long to transfer the money\n",
      "50. I’ve used several money transfer companies, and after testing Remitly, I can say you offer the best low-cost service. However, speed is a major issue. For example, sending money to Somalia can take up to 4 days—that’s not acceptable in 2025, especially when other companies can deliver in minutes.If you improve your transfer speed, especially for urgent situations, I believe you could gain millions of customers who currently use those faster services. I still use those alternatives when time is critical.\n",
      "51. Not good Someone hacked my ID the day before yesterday, I didn't even know.\n",
      "52. No offer ur giving for long term existing customers\n",
      "53. Not good you are not replying\n",
      "54. Worst company ever. Please don’t send money through Remitly, they will hold your money for days and when you call member services they’ll leave you on hold for hours. No valid explanation of why they are not releasing the money. Just waste of time\n",
      "55. Horrible service. I have been using Remitely for over a year. Almost all my transactions were to my wife when I was out the country, and sometimes to myself when in a foreign country (due to safety). At one particular time I urgently needed money on my MPESA for my own marriage. I resorted to Remitely as it was the only choice I had at that moment: my account was instantly suspended without proper reason. The already stressy day become much worse as I needed their service --thinking it was reliable.I went to their website and started a chat-session. To my surprise they told me \"we have suspended your account [but we cannot tell you why]\". Haha, funny. Never depend on Remitely. There are alternatives.\n",
      "56. I was manipulated badly trying to send 200 pounds to my grandchildren in Egypt, I send all the documents they asked for, it didn't work out and I had to cancel, and used Taptap instead, it was done with no hassle. Remitly said I have to wait for my refund for 10 days.\n",
      "57. I like Remitly because of the low sending fee and high exchange rate sometimes.  However; I always worried that they automatically deduct it from your account instead of having it send to their account.  This is why I always have to delete my card and just use Remitly seldom due to this.\n",
      "58. The high fee charged when transferring from dollar to dollar is another reason why it’s not a preferred option.\n",
      "59. First time user. A travel agent asked to pay them via Remitly, so I sent the money and created an account as requested.Remitly first took the money and, a couple of minutes later, suspended my newly-created account. I asked them to review the situation and shortly after they came back with a decision to permanently deactivate my account. And adding that they won't tell me why.In the meantime, they have my money, which they will send back to me in 2 weeks. Thieves.\n",
      "60. I SENT MONEY (TWICE) AND IT STAYED PENDING. TRANSACTIONS WERE NEVER COMPLETED AND I HAD TO CANCEL.THE RECEPIENT AND MY INFORMATION WAS THE SAME SOTHERE WAS NOTHING TO UPDATE.SUPER INCONVINIENT.\n",
      "61. Remitly should have its corresponding bank in Ghana verify or check the identity of recipients before releasing payments. I made a mistake in entering the phone number of my intended recipient and the money went to the wrong person. I have had my intended recipient submit the transaction receipt to correct the error. MTN Mobile Money in Ghana has still not corrected the error. To think that I have lost $300 from incorrectly entering the last three digits as 382 instead of 302 is surprising and depressing to me. That incorrect payment would not have happened with Western Union,\n",
      "62. My account got suspended for no reason and I’m not very happy with your company. Seems like they just wanna scam you and get your card number and then they give you some random number and chat to talk to that doesn’t even exist or work. No one in the company really can help you and it only works one time so they get your information\n",
      "63. I used Remitly to send funds to a tour company, expecting a quick and reliable transaction. Unfortunately, it has been over four days, and the money still has not been delivered to the recipient.Even worse, Remitly has already taken money, from my bank and now I’m left with no service, and no support. I’ve contacted their customer service several times, but no one is willing to explain what’s going on. It feels like I’ve been completely ignored.I did not receive what I paid for, and this delay has caused embarrassment. This level of service is absolutely unacceptable for a financial company handling people’s money.If you’re considering using this company to transfer funds, think twice – once they have your money, you’re on your own.\n",
      "64. Take too long for money to arrive. Too much many delays for processing money. It takes 1 day and half to receive money.\n",
      "65. Its been 3 weeks that i have not got my bank card though i am a premium card holder . I might not continue with my revolut account . By next week i will cancel my account and subscription\n",
      "66. Was my 4th time sending money. I am still being asked to upload a copy of my passport, which i have uploaded before. Thought first 2 times was enough.Friendly staff, no doubt - well done.But each transaction  took more than an hour each time\n",
      "67. I was sending money for a funeral in bits abroad and I got banned and eventually barred due to a policy rule stick to global companies like western union, they are tax dodgers.\n",
      "68. They Took over $270 sent, it shows delivered but was never ever in my bank, went to my bank and they showed me that it never delivered, called remitly and they confirmed it was sent, later they lied it's a wrong account number, and guess what I used the same account number to receive another transaction from them and it came through. It's been over 3 weeks and I still haven't seen my money. Today they took another $20. It's ridiculous that remitly will allow their staff steal from their clients,, because I strongly suspect there's someone within remitly stealing from their clients. I already knew remitly will typically ask me to go to their support but guess what it; it's typically same answer and same taking clients for granted when you clearly know it's a challenge from your end. I'll go to the remitly Whatsapp channel and Chat with and come back here to paste the exact replies and outcome.\n",
      "69. I dont know them to be like this. They are always efficient but this time They caused me serious pain by delaying my transfer for days putting my family in distress. If you check my message, it is a past tense expression. Check all my complaints looking for adol**k@y. com or Adesina Oluwafemi\n",
      "70. I wish I could give negative rating for their customer service. The worst I’ve ever experienced\n",
      "71. Not good platform for sending money, Facebook showing high rate to join more customers but website very less rate. Not faster as others take few hours for process. Will not recommend. 👎🏾👎🏾\n",
      "72. This program is part of a process indicating that the transfer operation requires a waiting period of up to twenty-four hours, during which patience is expected from the users. Upon contacting the concerned party, it is clarified that these procedures are considered standard practice\n",
      "73. The App is amazing but my account was suspended for 2 weeks without any communication or any reason. This was a inconvenience\n",
      "74. Impossible to contact customer support and get assistance. Also impossible to get Remitly to take responsibilitywhen they have made a mistake. They hide between a fog of unclear answers.\n",
      "75. Was using it and all was fine then they suspended my account for no reason at all saying I was going against terms and conditions but I wasn’t at all because I read the terms and conditions and everything I was sending the money for wasn’t against that I was literally sending my girlfriend money for daily things like food and stuff to help her out they wouldn’t tell me why they suspended my account and wasn’t helpful at all\n",
      "76. This Company is a joke! Please look elsewhere. They promise heavens on earth, but delivers junk. I sent money to a former school mate who has been diagnosed with a serious ailment for an urgent operation. This useless company took my money and refused to send it. Why? Because I already had an account, and I opened another. I never saw anywhere on their website where it said you cannot have two accounts. They are both in my name, identity verified. They closed both accounts, and held on to my money and kept mute! Return my money or send it, No. Meanwhile, the receiver is facing serious, life threatening issues.  Operation cannot be done without the money! Very insensitive. Why take my money and refused to respond? How much have this Company taken from people and behaved the same way?\n",
      "77. I sent 500 € to Colombia one month ago and the money has not arrived yet.\n",
      "78. Very poor service. After sending money transfers in hold for security chks. Which not required as i am a  verified customer seinding family regulerly.Dispointed.Not so great. Not recomended.Mr bhari.\n",
      "79. Took very long time to send a small amount of payment.\n",
      "80. took over 5 days to send the money, i could have delivered the money faster if i went by road.\n",
      "81. We transfer some money from US to Canada and it took weeks of delay and finally it failed without giving us any real explanation.It is a simple basic money transfer it should only take a day or two but it dragged on for weeks and eventually failed.Why ?No explanation and it caused me to wonder should I trust Remitly in the future to perform a simple transaction.\n",
      "82. I didn't get my refund back after I send money to the receiver, because due to some adjustments on amount advised so the receiver money. I was advised to get refund back but did not showed on my account on the app. My $60.00 was gone. I have emailed but no response.\n",
      "83. All good, I like this service.\n",
      "84. This is one of the worst app I ever download on my phone never again I would never recommend this up to anyone\n",
      "85. I love the experience using this app because I got my money.I would give a 5star but the only thing is that it takes 3day for you to get your money if it was faster that would be great.. love it good app\n",
      "86. This was one of the bad experiences i had with this app . I just used it few times and other day they just deactivated my account for suspicious activity. I called and answered and given all details but they won’t reopen my account. Even the customer service was worse can’t do anything.\n",
      "87. I have used this service at least 10 times over 2yrs since changing from Western Union. It has been good except for my last 2 transactions. This review is specifically for people sending money to Samoa.Be aware that whilst it is convenient to send money via a mobile app I have encountered a couple of issues.1) The exchange rate, I noticed, was 10cents less that sending via Pacific Ezy. Yes you have to go in store, but if you sending a large amount of money, you can get extra for  the aiga. This will be up to remitly to compete with other agencies. However, despite Remitly having low processing fees (compared to $10 per transaction at Pacific Ezy) Remitly recoup more profit by providing a poor exchange rate.2) Using remitly, on my transaction 2/7/25, the transfer was delayed. Be careful if aiga in Samoa need urgent cash. There were multiple online excuses (via their online chatbot) including the Network in Samoa was down, the receiving bank was undergoing maintenance thus delaying the processing of the transaction or the service providing the cash payout in Samoa was low on funds??? It took 24hrs for the funds to arrive. I had to call Remitly to chase my cash and they advised me to provide the bank account of the the receiver and they would credit the funds there. Now they told me it would take a further 24hrs to reach the account. However, this was not the case, from sending from NZ to Samoa took 24hrs and 3 phone calls to remitly. Please be mindful that there are times when a rapid transfer nay not occur. The reasons are vague.3) On 12/7/25 I wanted to send money to Samoa. I do send money to family a lot. Now whanau please be aware and check the transaction details BEFORE submitting for processing. As I was about to tempt fate...lol and submit to send the transaction. It came up with a window that I had to confirm, which states that the transaction will take 3 to 4 days, giving the same excuses as the above previous transaction.Please be aware that Remitly does work most times, but there is something weird happening with the service to Samoa at this time. If money needs sending urgently, I would use another method.P.S. I do not work for Pacific Ezy or Western Union\n",
      "88. I’m still waiting for a refund for a transfer I tried to make to Brazil, but it went through again. That was the last time I used this service, it’s the worst !Please don’t tell me it can take up to 10 days depending on my bank, as my bank has confirmed they don’t hold any funds. Once they receive the money, it’s instantly available in my account. Therefore, the money is still with Remitly\n",
      "89. I started using Remitly two months ago.  I send small amounts every week via mobile transmission to support family and friends.  There have been no problems until I decided to send a large amount to be deposited into a bank account. They advertise that the account should be credited in three to five days.  So, after three days, I could see in their system that there was a delay they were working on.  I rang to find out about the delay and how long it would take to resolve.  All all three occasions, the answer was the same and vague: \"we are working on it\".  I rang on 8th July 2025 and they said the money had been successfully transmitted.  This was also reflected in their app. They promised the money should be credited into my account within three days, depending on the receiving bank.  14th July 2025, the the receiving bank had not received the money.  They asked for the name of the correspondent bank and the reference number so that they could track it. I chased Remitly and they said they had done their part, and the receiver's account had been credited.   They said they could not give me the name of the transmitting bank because it was secret.  The same day, 14th July 2025 I received an email from Remitly saying that they had not sent the money.  They wanted to see my bank statement before sending the money.  I instantly sent them the bank statement and followed with a phone call to find out why they needed to see my bank statement and how long it would take to transfer the money which they had earlier claimed that they had already transmitted.  The person on the phone said that the email was not from Remitly. This was confusing.  I again asked to be given their correspondent bank money transmission reference, which again they insisted they cannot because it was secret.  They sent me some funny reference number without revealing the transmitting bank.  The receiving bank has told me the reference number they have given doesn't tell anything in the banking system.  Right now, I do not know where my money is, and why they handle transactions like Crypto platforms, where everything is opaque.  Are they trading with the money? And why do they keep lying to me? To prove that I am genuine, their reference number is R21965835367\n",

      "96. It is quick but can be very confusing to get an issue sorted out with proper explanations.\n",
      "97. Sneaky fees!!!! Do NOT use!!!Before i send money, i chatted with an agent, and she confirmed that no fees for apple pay. Before i hit send, there was no fees charged. I sent it and check my acct, voila there was a $15.89 charged!!!  Do NOT EVER use! Go with western union where everything is transparent- you will see the fees charged and the total amount to pay! First and last time using remitly and NEVER EVER again!!! What a way to defraud people.\n",
      "98. I sent money yesterday 07/11/25. More than 12 hrs of what was a speed transaction, my recipient still had not gotten the money.

Only explanation was \"security issue and we can't tell you anything else\".No discussion and absolutely no recourse to reinstate.Interesting canned reply.I was told that there is not a human to talk to and once the computer flags you there is nothing that can be done . They refuse to tell you the issue and there is no recourse to fix this. You can have no problems for years and then suddenly they delete your account.Good luck if you choose to use Remitly.\n",

I have verified and re-verify the bank account number so it can't be the account number. It is really frustrating. I have used RIA for a long time and I thought I could rely on them. Apparently not.\n",
      "30. The transfer fees for this transaction was too high, $12.   Kindly adjust or refund or reduce the transaction fees or show me how to avoid transfer fees\n",
      "31. It is stupid to ask for social security number for a transaction that is less than 100 dollars. You should be reported.Then why Moneygram, Western Union, doesn't do the same? If you send more than $1000.00 is ok to ask for ID, and if you send more than $3000.00 is ok to ask for Social Security. If I see my info licked, I will blame you. Thank you.\n",
      "32. Too much time before get payment\n",
      "33. Transfer rates are very slow these days. They take money first and volunteerly holding 4 business days and send it. Very very poor cheap business tactics\n",
      "34. As it’s been almost 3 years that using Ira for sending money but still like a new or first time customer Less amount to send but high fess and charges .Pleas as existing customer I suppose to have some bonus or credit at the point.Thank you\n",
      "35. my transaction of $90 has been cancelled with no reason after 4 days?\n",
      "36. First of all the exchange rate was not accurate, they wanted to give me 5000 mex pesos for 450 euro. On internet it was 9800 mex pesos. (Date 9 July) , that’s a huge difference right?Secondly I was waiting and waiting because the scanner was broke to scan passports.. eventually no pesos for me.. this was at Brussels airport, near gates A.I advise to check rates online before to change any money there.\n",
      "37. The transfer fees went up all of a sudden. Will have to find another money transfer company\n",
      "38. I usually use the Ria Brixton branch to transfer money to my cousin in SA and I usually have such a great experience with the staff who serve me until today! The staff member called Julisa P has a stinking unprofessional attitude problem and even got my cousin's phone number wrong after I told her it and she didn't even bother to repeat the number back to me to ensure that she got it correct. Her whole demeanor was that off a person who does not know how to work as a customer service agent and who has no professionalism serving customers, she is just toxic! Even the energy behind the desk was different and you can blatantly tell that the staff working with her today did not want to engage too much with her. Even talking in her language to another colleague whilst serving me, and her colleagues where looking at me and then looking at her whilst she was taking! Leave your stinky attitude at home dear, because you never know who your serving or who may know your CEO. This is so incorrect. Next time, I will avoid her like the plague even if she is free, I will decline to be served by her again ! Hopefully she will not be there again when I go there!\n",
      "39. The actual rate displayed on the homepage is different when transferring, also shows $0 fee in home page and charging when transferring.\n",
      "40. I dislike the app at this moment. To put my 3 numbers on the app it's not working u need check that part out.\n",
      "41. it repeatedly showed I had made payments that it hadn't received. even gave me a receipt. misleading.\n",
      "42. Ive sent money with you to gambia to my wife for 5 years. But your website is shocking. I just spent over 1 hour trying to send money because I could not scroll down. Your website is very frustrating.\n",
      "43. I have used Ria several times, but it will be the last time. I have made a transfer on June 3rd and their customer service team reached out for more information about the Beneficiary. The information was provided and it is already a month and there is still nothing happening.The transfer was pending since then with several follow up emails, one reply informing they would reach out to the Beneficiary’s bank. A second reply after sending a reminder, stating they would reach out again and it has been now two reminders in different weeks and now there is just silence but my money was withdraw from my account.I have now requested the cancellation and now waiting if they will even reply or not.I have another issue in December last year where a transfer was still pending/processing for weeks. After speaking to the customer service agent who confirmed he would cancel the transaction, this still shows as processing.The care for the customer is nonexistent.\n",
      "44. Mobile App will not allow phone number country code to be changed trying to login\n",
      "45. It’s getting cancelled evry single time.This is incredibly frustrating! I’ve been using this service without any problems for a long time, and now, out of nowhere, all my transfers are being canceled — but the money is still taken from my bank account!Nothing changed on my side: same card, same account, same browser. Customer support keeps giving me vague excuses about “technical issues” with no real explanation or solution.My money is stuck, transfers don’t go through, two weeks of constant stress. Today, the exact same thing happened again. I’m extremely disappointed. If this is a ‘technical issue’, why is no one fixing it??\n",
      "46. Now when i transfered the money to a new account, the amount was credited instantly. But when I send to already send account number, after a day also the amount was not credited.\n",
      "47. I don't like the waiting time for the receiver to get the money. The company doesn't care about the emergency of the situation. Before there is no waiting time. We took it in consideration.\n",
      "48. the list of reasons to transfer are not enough\n",
      "49. Four days is way too long for a money transfer. Never happened earlier.\n",
      "50. Ready to send again to the Philippines?Use promo code RIAX2 to get a 0 € fee transfer.*Konnte ich nicht eingeben :(can not use the promp !  :(it is not working...  3.50€ must pay and i can not use the promo !\n",
      "51. Ria is STILL sending the confirmation emails to the wrong email address, even though we have told them half-a-dozen times in a dozen emails over a year and a half. The money gets to where it has to go, but if they cannot fix a simple thing like this, how safe is the data they hold? And the customer service is appalling. We have been ignored or patronised or mocked for bringing this up.\n",
      "52. evry single time its getting cancelled\n",
      "53. Woke up to fraudulent activity on my back account from this company. I’ve never used it before. They deleted a comment on their instagram from me on a post explaining what happened within 5 minutes but have not replied to my DM. I have never used this company, never heard of them. Their security is lacking and they don’t care.\n",
      "54. right now, a little slow when sending.usually 5 min arrived,by now take aday using debit card to the bank account\n",
      "55. forgat my information from before\n",
      "56. Your compliance staff does not answer messages. The actual transfer of money was conducted well once a whole lot of paperwork was done. However, I am also concerned that we were limited to $5000 per transaction after being told by your team we could send up to $20K, and made that arrangement with our bank.\n",
      "57. The web interface is not user friendly. I had a hard time getting country options.\n",
      "58. Simply ria will destroy your peace of mind. Why ? Ok , they hold your money in there account than send you one email to upload more documents. That's it, it's neverending process. If you call them at one hour to talk with compliance again new problems. I was with them with one transaction more than 10 days . It's shocking really. I was trying to send money to Bangladesh. Please stay away from them even they offer little bit good more rate but it's there technic\n",
      "59. The resend button to send to same person every month doesnt work at all. I need to manually enter the details and 5-6 extra clicks instead every time. I use Firefox browser btw.\n",
      "60. Love great transition\n",
      "61. The worst service I have ever hadI made an urgent transfer on the 16th June, but my recipient never received the money. In the system it says: transfer complete, money paid out. In fact the recipient never received the money. Therefore, I had to contact their Customer Service quite a few times and speak to their Team leader to provide me the proof of payment, as they claimed the money was paid, but they could not provide any proof at all, which made the situation worse. This clearly indicates, they have sent the money to someone who is not my recipient, or they never made the payment to anyone, or they never transferred the money at all. On this circumstances, I've decided to a legal action by making an official complaint via Ombudsman Financial Service, UK for  my money along with a compensation, as it is nearly 7 days, the problem remained same. I will suggest customers to be careful about using their service from now. I am unhappy, unsatisfied with their poor, unprofessional, unethical, substabdard service.\n",
      "62. Rates are getting worse, as are indicated service completion timelines.\n",
      "63. Sometimes the transfer takes too long to be deposited, I have to cancel it and go to physical location and do it personally\n",
      "64. it kept asking me to verify my information, it kicked me out with some error, and even asked for a selfie and picture of my drivers license.  and all that to deny my transfer.\n",
      "65. Exchanged rate offer is way to low compare to others.\n",
      "66. This is the worse money sending company I ever see, they locked my account in my first transaction after I went through all the security procedures sent the money went receiver went to pick up guess what no money, don’t enroll with this company,safe your self some headaches in the not far away future. This is the worse money sending company\n",
      "67. We do not get a receipt slip with full details for the money we send to India. Receive!\n",
      "68. Sometimes it doesn't give proper error messages for unsuccessful. but just give internal policies.\n",
      "69. need instruccion in spanish\n",
      "70. Your App not  working good.\n",
      "71. Low rate + transfer fee.\n",
      "72. Last time I transferred money to India it took 5 days, and before it took only couple of hours.  Also there was a message it can be transferred in one day for an additional fee.   If this is the new policy, I will not use Ria anymore.  There are plenty of other options.\n",
      "73. Rate is Ok, but the speed for bank transfer is really slower than slower\n",
      "74. My account is locked out and not getting any help from the customer service to resolve the issue\n",
      "75. Trying first time because my coworker mentioned it. The website logged me out twice with unexpected error message. The Plaid service and personal ID verification was quick, although it crashed again after completion of verification. Third time login and the transfer attempt went fine. It auto picked a promo but, higher the amount lower the rate. :-)\n",
      "76. Worst customer service. Very rude to all customers. Also it’s very slow even if you send 2$ as donation it will take up to 6 to 7 days . Very slow and worst and not good for anything on time\n",
      "77. the time it takes to receive confirmation to collect the money\n",
      "78. Takes too long for delivery. You make people sad and angry.\n",
      "79. Too many failure and refresh. Had to startover for one transaction\n",
      "80. Earlier the transfer use to take hours. But now every time it is taking 4 days. As a regular customer this change is not in my favor.\n",
      "81. Taking time for the transaction to get complete and have additional transaction fee on each every transaction. Which is not the case earlier with Ria.\n",
      "82. Started off really well and sent money really quickly and swiftly. I then sent a large amount of money to which Ria and their staff dealt with very unprofessionally. They requested documents from me which I sent and they approved. They then emailed me requested further documents to which I replied and sent 15mins later - but no reply. I then called 4 days later and was transferred through to three different departments to which their reply was “thanks, that seems acceptable. We will get back to you in 30mins with a reply.” I then get an email asking for the same documents which I’ve already sent before. I immediately replied and still did not get a reply a day later. This is very unprofessional and has happened to a close friend of mine during the same time and he has had to call them every single day but they still have not resolved it for him.\n",
      "83. Very not safe website to send money.Your money are unprotected and you can loose everything.I just tried first time and lost 520€.RIA told me will investigate case but it did nothing and just simply closed my account.Be aware!\n",
      "84. I had a disappointing experience with Ria Money Transfer. The service was inefficient, as my transfer was held for an extended period under review without clear communication. Additionally, I encountered difficulties reaching customer support, as my calls were not answered and my emails went unanswered.Furthermore, I was asked to provide documentation that should have been requested at the time of the transaction. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend Ria Money Transfer to others.\n",
      "85. It said Other  Transfer sent ,But was never received\n",
      "86. Takes longer to deposit\n",
      "87. The process is very fast, but the fund is actually in the bank in 4 to 5 days.In my previous experiences (have been using RIA for over 15 years), after processing the transfer on the 3rd of the month, the fund is shown as deposited the next day.\n",
      "88. While Ria offers competitive exchange rates and fair fees, my experience with transfers has been inconsistent. Payments via PayID often take weeks to process, and my debit card frequently gets blocked by the bank during transactions, adding unnecessary delays.Sending money overseas feels like a gamble—sometimes it takes minutes, other times days or even weeks. Because of this unpredictability, I only use Ria for non-urgent transfers. For time-sensitive transactions, I rely on Western Union instead.If reliability improved, Ria would be a great option, but for now, the slow processing and technical issues make it hard to fully recommend.\n",
      "89. The offer to send money without a fee didn’t work as a new person who’s using the service, as stated on the website. So not a great first impression.\n",
      "90. Ria’s new transaction model or restrictions are not friendly and customers hate it . Moving out\n",
      "91. Extremely difficult to process the transfer. Taking this new step of ID was not the best. When I called, the Agent informed me that my limit was certain amount and didn’t need to send my ID. come to find out, it does.\n",
      "92. Jean Escamille\n",
      "93. Website refused several tries at registration, unclear on details required, Recipient infor mation ID card number rejected no reason given. Finally after several tries went through same number.\n",
      "94. Too many bad things but let me list top 2:1. The limit is 3000, and I am unable to verify the account to increase the limit. Tried verification N number of times.2. Processing time 4 days\n",
      "95. Nowadays RIA is taking more time to send teh amount to recipient.\n",
      "96. Service used to be very good earlier. Now a days for any transaction it takes 4 days.\n",
      "97. Really poor service. technology is rubbish and customer service non existent unless you chase the CEO.First time the screen went blank when I tried the 2 FA. No news, no contact from company to explain if the transfer went through or not. Seriously annoying and time wasting. Then I find money has left my account but nothing to tell me it has.\n",
      "98. For some strange reason, The website is very slow and NOT loading instantly, its taking quite long to transfer the money. This is the 1st time, I having this web slowness.\n",
      "99. App is dead slow. The transfer is taking longer times now a days. Several days upto a week.\n",
      "100. Getting late to send money\n",
      "101. The money transfer used to take same day and now its asking 11$ for the same !!\n",
      "102. anagry over $1 dollar charge and trying to delay that happened in the past and curretly too\n",
      "103. Every time it changes the rate for sending money,  before was in mins when I send account bank to account bank now, they want us to pay more so can receive the money fast.Thank yo\n",
      "104. The value of the dollar is very low, the transfer cost is reasonable\n",
      "105. Usually my transfer use to get only few hours, But this time its taking very longtime, even my process yet to be completed\n",
      "106. transfer doesnt happen quickly. for quick transfer you ask extra money which is totally wrong.\n",
      "107. Forced to share my identify proof, driver license front, back, barcode, while I am not willing to disclose my personal sensitive info. Have been using the account for transfers from years, what is the point of re-verifying identify and trying to keep getting my personal sensitive info ?\n",
      "108. Rate is not increasing\n",
      "109. I was shocked by the very high transfer fee of $15 Canadian dollars. I would have to go with another money transfer company, unless you offer me special discount. I've been a Ria customer for several years; the more than 100% ($5 to $15) sudden increase in the fee was a great shocker for me. Otherwise, I haven't had any issues.\n",
      "110. unwanted questions and suggesstions to use debit card.\n",
      "111. i took long to get through\n",
      "112. I did not like the delay caused by the unnecessary request for details of source of funds after I had provided them most recently.\n",
      "113. Signed up to send my gf in Cambodia money.  Could not do it from app.  Had to go through an appeal process to prove it wasn’t fraudulent.   I guess I am somehow.Round two send through an agent.  First time, pos didn’t work, 2nd time pos didn’t work, 3rd time, system down over a long weekend.\n",
      "114. Transfer used to be quick with bank accounts earlier. Now, its taking more than 4 days for transfer to complete though the source and destination accounts were validated.\n",
      "115. I have been using RIA i can’t access my account i chatted 2 times with customer service team they didn’t solve my problem.Its just wasting of time\n",
      "116. You already rip us off in your exchange rates and now you want to charge us $2 more to process our remittance immediately as you used to always.  If we now don't pay the extra $2 you will hold our remittance an extra 4 days!  Needless to say this might be the last time I send money through you unless I cannot find another company to do my monthly business with.\n",
      "117. It's been 5days and the money I sent it's still on hold. I don't recommend.  The worse app ever.\n",
      "118. Ria is taking longer than expected to transfer the money now a days and going to deficient performance.\n",
      "119. it didn't give me a chance to update the transfer details\n",
      "120. My previous transaction got cancelled without providing reason for cancellation.\n",
      "121. don't like if there is any recent changes but now it showing it will take 4 business days to make a money transfer unless I use my debit card, although I was using direct account from last more than 7-8 yrs. Probably need to find some other service for my future transactions.\n",
      "122. Not letting me pay directly from my bank. Asking me to take the receipt to a 7/11.I don't have time to go to 7/11. Horrible service.Not using Ria again.\n",
      "123. The error message was not clear. I have contacted Cust Service. seems they were not able to help and escalated the issue. But haven't heard anything back yet. It has been 2 days.\n",
      "124. The rate was 8.74 cedis to AUD$ when I started the transaction. At the end the rate changed to 7.9 cedis to AUD$. I'm not impress for the sudden changes.\n",
      "125. It used to take around 30 minutes for wire transfer but now taking 4 business days. Have to pay good fee for debit card transfer.\n",
      "126. Ria is going a crap. everytime I try to transfer money you give me a surprise.\n",
      "127. I sent money it went pretty quick, now it's stuck with their transfer partner. Even though I sent them my brother's ID, they couldn't transfer it to my brother and now they are sending emails requesting my brother's picture. What's my brother's picture got to do with anything. The ones on Messenger are rude and don't want to answer my questions. I'm thinking of asking for a refund as well but I'll hear what they say tomorrow?\n",
      "128. In the past for verified accounts you guys used to get deposit completed within minutes or not later than 2 hours to the recepient.  Now you guys say it takes 4 business days.  That is very inconvenient\n",
      "129. My transfer is still in review after 36 hours. I have provided lengthy information, I was told that they will be checked in max an hour. There is no feedback what so ever. I just started a new transfer as the money is needed urgently. Ria is a pain everytime I use it.\n",
      "130. You are a difficult site to use and I won't use you again\n",
      "131. i needed to repite the process many times, and my bank Banco de Bogota didnt work\n",
      "132. This is just a follow-up to your response. i am in call with them and the compliance department do not answer the phone. It is taking to long i have been waiting on their response 20 minuts now.Would you please help to solve this matter.my order number is, DK45258126\n",
      "133. Long term user. Disappointed. £5 discount code offered for making a transfer in April 2025 didn't work. Should be valid until 31 May as per T&Cs. No human help available to help.\n",
      "134. Rate can be improved.Fee can be reduced.\n",
      "135. sent money on the 1st got message that it was ready the next day today is the 6th and still not there yet. had to cancel and resend it hopping it gets there on time.\n",

      "1. It is easy to use the system than few years ago. What are those typed number showing on second box next to name?8\n",
      "2. I had an extremely bad experience with Western Union. On 25/07/2025, I made a transfer of £418.81 (Transfer No. 3479583275) to Mehmet Salih in Turkey. I had previously sent money to the same receiver on 24/12/2024 (MTCN 040-269-3131) where both my passport and the receiver’s ID card were uploaded and verified in their system.Despite this, the recent transaction was stopped for a “compliance check” and I was told it would take 48 hours. When I called on 27/07/2025, the compliance representative was unhelpful and when I asked for a supervisor, I was kept on hold for over 15 minutes. The supervisor eventually came on the line but said they couldn’t help as the department holding my transaction was a different team and only promised to “email them” to call me.I explained clearly that all required ID documents are already stored in their system from the previous transfer, yet they still blocked the payment. I also requested a refund and was told it cannot be cancelled.This is completely unacceptable customer service. It appears that Western Union unfairly flags transactions to people with Islamic names like Mehmet under the excuse of “compliance checks.” I have been left without my goods and without my money.I will never use Western Union again and do not recommend them to anyone.\n",
      "3. Ho effettuato una transazione con Western Union il 4 luglio 2025 per un importo di 600€. Il destinatario non ha mai ricevuto i soldi, anche se la transazione risulta \"completata\".Da allora ho contattato il servizio clienti decine di volte: via telefono, email e modulo di reclamo. Ogni volta ricevo risposte automatiche, link generici o promesse di aggiornamenti che non arrivano mai.Sono passati più di 3 settimane e nessuno ha fornito una risposta concreta o una soluzione. Ho seguito tutte le procedure indicate, ma senza risultato.Trovo inaccettabile che un'azienda come Western Union ignori i reclami di questo tipo, soprattutto trattandosi di somme importanti e di un servizio che dovrebbe garantire sicurezza nelle transazioni.Chiedo che il mio caso venga finalmente preso in carico da una persona reale e risolto immediatamente.On June 4th, 2025, I made a transaction through Western Union for €600. The recipient never received the money, even though the transaction shows as “completed.”Since then, I have contacted customer service dozens of times: by phone, email, and through the official complaint form. Every time, I receive automatic replies, generic links, or promises of updates that never arrive.It has now been over 3 weeks, and I still haven’t received a clear or concrete answer. I followed every procedure requested, but nothing has been resolved.I find it unacceptable that a company like Western Union can ignore serious issues like this, especially when it involves such a large amount of money and a service that should guarantee security in transactions.I ask that my case be urgently handled by a real person and resolved immediately.\n",
      "4. I have used Western Union for years for money transfers internationally to Canada from USA without any problems. Today I experienced no issues sending. The receiver however had issues finding a location in Ottawa Canada that still participates with Western Union. Sadly, no money transfer business in Ottawa Canada participates with this company any longer. Western Union should either flag the system to reflect this lack of participation for the senders or remove the foreign businesses as working locations.Money Gram works instead for anyone sending to this location and the fees were far less.\n",
      "5. Everything goes wrong with western unionAvoid at all costsCustomer service diabolical if you can understand them that isHead of company should sort this out.\n",
      "6. The company charges 15 $ ON 300 $Tansfer from Lebanon to Qatar, I received only 277 $. They collect money cash in US$.Total pay 315 $ . Total received 277$This company is steeling customers.I don't advice this company.\n",
      "7. I sent money and they deposited it into a bank account that doesn't exist and refused to help\n",
      "8. Don’t use it. It’s incredibly inconvenient and they will made you pay high fees and come to the office for many time\n",
      "9. dont use western union,unless you want to be ripped off,i sent off close to $300 and my partner not even get it and itsgoing to take 20days to get an answer,back from them,scammers have found a way to get into there site\n",
      "10. I did a money transfer on 18th July 2025 and till today I have not recieved it i sent them required information they requested 3 days ago and still they are reviewing this is disgusting.In fact the reality of western union is that they hold your money earn money on your money and then they release it.And I needed money for many needs for which I transfered it using western union channel thinking it is fast and reliable.I will never use them again and the people around me will share my experience with them so they can avoid using it.I called since 21st July daily more then 5 times to check status what's going on because I needed my money urgently.Alas there customer service is just laughing at you and not ready to get your matter solved ASAP.Disgusting experience\n",
      "11. Horrible.     I have used them several times over the years but last few times my transfers were “ questioned “.    I’m middle classed working person.   I don’t have much money.   My son needs money maybe twice a month that I send to him.  I’m 300 miles away.     After an hour —- no transfer.   I call.  A India man with thick accent answers and asks me WHY I’m sending money.   The reason why. To whom.   What’s he going to do with it      He approves or not.   And I’ve been denied last couple times for telling him my son gets the money because I help him financially while he’s in school.     He denied me.I learned that CHIME and VENMO and MONEYGRAM are much better and cheaper than western union and their boneheads.     Usually send to chime to chime ( free).  When I have money on Venmo he can withdraw that for free to his chime acct by linking my Venmo to his chimeOne good thing the India boneheads taught me was to find other ways to transfer money and truly western union is OBSOLETE!!      If you absolutely have to do a transfer like this —- check into MONEYGRAM at Walmart.      Very fast.  Immediate transfer and much cheaper  !!!\n",
      "12. I've been trying to transfer a sum from Germany to Montenegro, online.First, when I tried to switch payment method from Google Pay to Card, it stuck in a redirect loop for half an hour, sometimes displaying an error.Then it started logging me out after any action for a while.After, I gave up trying and decided to transfer from Google Pay. Then payment authorization in Google Pay succeeds and nothing happens. Nothing at all. Luckily, then don't even try to take my money.How can anyone trust their money to a company, that can't even make a working website???In my country, the whole dev department responsible for this would be fined heftily.\n",
      "13. What is going wrong.???? I have to use cash to wire money to my wife and children… I have to travel for an hour and a half to get to my credit union… stand in there lines to withdraw money. Then have to stand in line for up to an hour to send the wire transfer from woodland on Dillingham in Honolulu, Hawaii… There are no more WU to transfer money to my family in the area I live in…I am looking for a new way of doing business from where I live… $10.47; two to three times a month… standing in lines at two different locations… maybe I should start charging ALL of you for my time… it is a hell of a lot more important than your time…\n",
      "14. I’ve been waiting since June 24th for a refund on transaction MTCN: 0724697881. The transfer failed due to a system issue on their side. On June 26th, I sent all requested documents. On July 3rd, I was told via email that the money was available for payout – which turned out to be false.On July 7th, after chasing their customer support multiple times, I was informed the transaction was canceled and a refund would be sent within 5–7 business days. Today is July 23rd, and I still haven’t received anything. After more follow-up, I was told the money was never sent – despite earlier claims it was processed on July 11th.This is outrageous: false information, no accountability, no follow-up, and complete lack of transparency. I’ve wasted time, energy, and trust in this company. I demand immediate refund, an explanation, and compensation for the trouble caused.Absolutely unacceptable service.\n",
      "15. Son un fraude 😡 me han estafado 450,99 €\n",
      "16. I've been using WU for a long time.Recently I needed to do an ID verification then they tell me I can't use my ID/residence permit,  I need to use my original ID from my country or passport, then I present that, then they tell me ID and passport from my country is not accepted on their system,,like WTF, I've sent thousands of euros over the years and there is western union outlets in my country,  this made no sense at all, took me 3 days trying to explain how my Residence permitis is my ID,,I instantly stopped using them,,,,now with remitly,  my ID verification with remitly went smooth and super fast....What a sh(**t show and inconvenience I went through with WU 🙄\n",
      "17. Terrible service\n",

      "19. Slow buggy useless website!IBAN number is not a secret number NOT NEED TO HIDE IT?????BANK what is didn't know what is sensitive information...\n",
      "20. I tried to send a transfer to my real estate agent in regard to a lease of a home in Panama. I could not do it online with my account, and went to a location to finish the transaction. I was able to complete the process, but had a message sent to me to call. I was told that they would not do the transfer due to the belief it is a fraud scheme, which it isn't. Despite my insistence on completing the transaction, I was denied, and my money (hopefully) will be refunded to my account. Due to this, I may lose the lease on the home and will not have a place to stay. I am beyond disappointed in your service, and will not use this again.\n",
      "21. I try so many times to use your app but there was so many problems that I got tired of using it, after 23 years of using your services I decided to go with money gram.\n",
      "22. The worse, experience ever was asking for my money, the agent keep hanging up on my face when I’m asking for money back, they cancel my transaction, Never thought this company will take my money!. Can't explain how sad and mad I'm with this company.\n",
      "23. I sent a transfer on 7/15 that was was supposed to hit within 0-4 business days.  It did not, I called and was told it would hit on 7/21.  It has not.  I was then told it would hit by 5:05pm today.  We shall see.  None of the agents can give a reason as to why it is taking so long to transfer and there is so much static on the line, you cannot hear half of what they say.  W.U. uses in intermediary bank. These banks hold fund and trade the money overnight to make more money.  Ok, I'll give you the 0-4 business days, but six days is just being greedy.  Can you guess what money transfer service I will not be using ever again Corporate greed is so out of hand.  Its profit over people and that is all companies care about.\n",
      "24. I made transfer on Saturday and the money left from my bank account and they are still holding the money on Monday! Customer service is a joke and I can’t call them from where I am now. They don’t give me any reason and amount is 250 e not millions heheh. What a joke. I should use Moneygram like it’s so much better in every way! People use Moneygram! Let’s see if they ever release my little money!\n",
      "25. My transfer was canceled but not by me. Western union says the bank canceled it and my bank says Western union canceled it. Either way my money has not yet been refunded to my account. I'm out $500.\n",

      "29. I have tried 6 times to get in touch with an agent to verify info on a transfer. I give the info and am transferred to an agent that never comes on. Most of the time the call disconnects in a little over 2 minutes.\n",
      "30. Everything is wrong with this application\n",
      "31. Your service fees and exchange rates are incredibly high and extortionate. I’ll never use you again. You are nothing but thieves\n",

      "41. WU did not allow me to use my bank account that I've already used without any issues for the latest transaction. I had to use GooglePay, which cost me additional money. It's a significant amount to do a wire transfer.\n",

      "56. The transfers i sent to Bangladesh were canceled and I was not notified. Then the refunds have not been made yet.\n",
      "57. The receiver’s bank says there are 2 deposits of $150 from Western Union one which they cannot verify. So receiver has not been able to withdraw. I have called WU and tried online but to no avail. What’s up with that?\n",
      "58. Transfers are taking way too long to reach recipients\n",

      "62. Very much disappointed, I was trying to send some money to India from my UK Bank account trough \"Bank Transfer\", unfortunately WU has send the money to WU location in India which is far far away from the receiver's address. Not only that, to collect the money , they need to open an account with KYC registered to Indian govt!!. Total hectic process, it took almost two weeks to collect the money. When contacted to WU, they just said it was a technical error and they don't know when it will be fixed!!!\n",
      "63. I sent Money but my receiver didn’t get the money cuz I mistake the nameAnd then I got email saying my money is refunded and I have to pick it upI went to to pick up money with sames mtcnBut they told me in the western union location the money got picked upBut it wasn’t me who picked up the money\n",
      "64. Absolutely rubbish service. Not trustworthy\n",
      "65. I made a transfer to bank account on 2nd of July.... it got processed for in person pick up. I reported it and it hasn't been resolved yet.... I requested for it to either proceed with the bank transfer or get the money refunded. I have been using this service for the past 6 years... never had any issue. This is the first time I had an issue and still waiting for it to be resolved.\n",
      "66. I have used Western Union all over the world by sending myself money.Every now and then they ask for me to upload my passport and proof of adsress,like a utility bill.The passport is no problem,the bill is impossible because i am full time digital nomad.I travel the world for years.so can not use Western Uniion any more.most tech companies now use digital face regonition through phone app.no.not WU.. they want an electric bill\n",
      "67. I sent money to my bro-in-law in Canada on May the 31st 2025---in the middle of the transaction, the lady at the front desk claimed that their system froze and system was down, therefore, transaction was NOT completed. So, he went to the next branch only to be told that money has been picked up.I filed a \"non-payment claim\", and was so stressed with the process.It's so frustrating to talk to agents who have been telling me the same thing over and over again. Their so called \" specialists\" aren't really doing their job. It has been almost 2 mos. and still no refund.I asked for a contact number of one of the people handling the case and they couldn't give me any.If there's a zero star, that's what I would give WU.I've been a loyal customer, and I use WU's service every month.Well, NEVER WU again.\n",
      "68. I made a money transfer via Western Union at the end of May. On June 4th, 2025, Western Union canceled the transaction and informed me that the refund had been processed. As of today, July 14th, 2025, I still have not received the funds in my account. I want a clear answer: Have I lost my money?--------------------------------J’ai effectué un transfert à la fin du mois de mai via Western Union. Le 4 juin 2025, Western Union a annulé la transaction et m’a informé que le remboursement avait été effectué. À ce jour, le 14 juillet 2025, je n’ai toujours pas reçu l’argent sur mon compte. Je veux une réponse claire : ai-je perdu mon argent ?\n",
      "69. I live in USA and I am traveling right now in Mexico. It seems like the western union website for sending money doesn't exist and I have to use the app. When I login to app it says \"My account was created in a different region ...\" and it switches me to a web page that requires a new login. This web page barely works. I have to type in the numbers to send like 10 times and as slow as possible before the web site will accept the numbers. Also the refresh is very slow and I keep thinking it is now broken.\n",
      "70. I sent a $2000 transfer from Yemen. I was charged $28 at the time of sending (acceptable), but when I went to collect the money, the agent in Turkey demanded $15 in cash to give me the transfer. This was not part of the official fee. This is unacceptable and damages the trust in your service. I tired to receive the money to my bank account directly but seems the system of Western Union has problem, i tired all ways but still could not take it to my bank directly. Shame on you scammers. I will not use Western Union again.\n",
      "71. Absolutely shocking service and still waiting for my complaint to be resolved - PLEASE SORT ASAP Western Union!!! You should be ashamed of treating customers this way...\n",
      "72. I was quoted $8 on the \"App\" to send money paying in person, and I was charged $11 instead. I even showed the clerk, and they said it doesn't matter. Our computer says $11\n",
      "73. I was informed that a money transfer overseas was rejected by the receiving bank. Western Union arranged a refund and issued a new MTCN number. But when I tracked the new refund number, it was showed that the refund was picked up at an earlier date. I did not do any pick-up and have been liaising with customer service for almost a monh without success. Ticket after ticket was raised for escalation with promise that someone would contact me via email or phone within 24 hours. It's been more than a month, countless calls and again with the same message that I will receive a response within 24 hours since my case is prioritized. Gave them 2 email addresses, my phone number...and no response. If there is a zero star, I would have given western union that.\n",
      "74. Very bad experience. I send moneny, 4 day hold. Why?After one weak later again send money 3 day hold. ......I dislike Western Union.Money Gram is good service.\n",
      "75. Transferring money to Malawi. Practically okay but the exchange rate is terrible. I ended up switching to an alternative with c. 75% better exchange rate.\n",
      "76. I trusted Western Union for a long time since I became a seafarer and Western is my main source to send money in the Philippines. It’s been 6 years in the row but I have no choice but to leave a feedback today. My old ship money card already expired and I had this new ship money card in which I can’t use everytime I tried to send money again for my family because it kept on saying I can “only use my payroll as payment” even if I input the correct card number as well as the expiration date and CVV. I messaged Western from May 2025 but up to this day, July 2025 nothing happened. I already showed the screenshot of the problem, I gave the first four digits of my number as well as the last digits, some of security questions. BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. Too much customer service support email me but again, nothing change. Please, I am begging to Western for a long time regarding this issue. My family needs me. I tried to be nice but please, be nice to your customers too. It is not right to kept them waiting for nothing. I hope when I leave this kind of feedback, you will take an action regarding my issue. Thankyou Western.\n",
      "77. I called customer service, and they did not give me a solution and the representative wouldn’t hang up the call so I can leave a review and asked me to hang up. When I asked her she need to end the call so I can leave a review she put me on hold. Been a long time customer, I have visited 4 locations today and no result customer service gave no solution and put me on hold so I won’t leave a review very unprofessional. I will be moving by business else where.\n",
      "78. The transferred amount is literally almost normal a delay in releasing ghe money for only $5000. So writes\n",
      "79. I send money  and didn't received and I was chasing over 1 money until I get my money back and didn't give me a  compensation and am not happy for the service and am ganaa trust again\n",
      "80. WU holds my money 4 days! it is not available within minutes like the app says when I am doing a transaction. I have been paying the same people with the same card/account for 2 years and you just started holding my money. That is false advertising and causes problems.\n",
      "81. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with how Western Union has handled my transfer. What I experienced feels like negligence and possible fraud.On June 30, 2025, I went to receive a money transfer from my brother. I visited multiple Western Union agents across Mississauga, and most told me they didn’t have enough cash or only send transfers. One Walmart location at 800 Matheson Blvd W took all my information and said they could only deposit the funds directly into my bank account using my debit card. They tried over five times, and the transaction kept failing. I never received the money, yet the transfer was marked as “paid.”I called Western Union on July 2nd to report the issue and followed up again on July 8th. I was told it would take 22 business days for an investigation — which is unacceptable, especially since no one has contacted me or my brother, and no one has even gone to Walmart to check the security video.When I asked the customer service agent what they would do about Walmart refusing to give me cash and marking the transaction as completed, she simply said, “we are waiting for Walmart to respond,” and gave me no answers about what action would be taken.This delay has caused me to fall behind on bills, created emotional stress, and taken up my time for something that should have been simple. I was supposed to receive the money in cash, not be forced to use a debit deposit that failed repeatedly. This is not acceptable.Western Union has shown a complete lack of urgency, responsibility, and customer care. I would never recommend using their services again.\n",
      "82. The fees are absolutely crazy for a money transfer inside the US!!!!!  I pay less in fees for transfers outside the US.  Just ridiculous. I’ll probably start using Zelle in the US now.\n",
      "83. Each time I sent money I do not get alert on my phone and I called Western Union asking for them to give me alert and I still haven’t get any alert. That is very bad. I need to know when family member pick up their money.\n",
      "84. you would not say i talked to at least 4 different people i have sent to same person several times and there was not a good reason in my opinion not to do because you could not verify my idenity ....BS07\n",
      "85. I had done a money transfer to India as bank transfer, but when I received the MTCN and acknowledgement email it said that the recipient needs to pick up the transfered amount.This caused lots of inconvenience.When I called the customer service they mentioned this was due to some technical issue in Western Union application and they cannot do anything.\n",
      "86. Because I was put on a limit on sending money to my wife, which I never had a limit before\n",
      "87. Honesty, reliable and trustworthy\n",
      "88. Junk its hard to view a receipt for payment. Even the tracking reference doesnt work..aviod im changing to a n other.\n",
      "89. App is extremely slow and outdated.reward program is worthless. I will be looking elsewhere for these types of apps.More expensive then other options.\n",
      "90. I have been sending money religiously for the last 3+ years . I was able to use my “$2discount” only once! Every single time I try , I. Get the ‘glitch’ response . Can’t go through, try again or go to a store. I always give the benefit of the doubt and try one or two more times until I have to start all over and make sure I DO NOT APPLY THE DISCOUNT I ALREADY ENTITLED TO . Just frustrating and annoying\n",
      "91. Every Time I send a WU to my receiver in New Jersey, the WU at pick up location is down for maintenance for several hours sometimes up to 12 to 16 hours down, so receiver has to wait to pick up money sometimes over 24 hrs.  This happens over and over and over.  It is a disgrace and unacceptable for the fees charged.\n",
      "92. I sent birthday gift £200 to my daughter in Spain two days ago and she hasn't been able to collect it\n",
      "93. I was not able to send a payment, got an error code.\n",
      "94. They asked me for additional information and always kept on hold my transactions.\n",
      "95. I have used Western Union service to transfer money to my landlord 3 month ago, after one day they rejected my transfer without any reason, and till today I couldn't get my money back, they just kept the money between my bank and their service, I just got some MTCN number, and I should be able to  get my money back from mobile bank which is not working and just shows error from WU, it's so frustrating\n",
      "96. I would give zero stars if I could. My money transfer was held for 5 days even though I paid the $3.99 fee for same day transfer. The call center escalated the transfer and I NEVER heard anything from them. I tried to cancel the transfer and the call center told me I couldn't and had to wait, because it was in the escalation department and no one was ever available for me to talk to. Even the supervisor refused to help me. MY money should never have been held from me. It should've been released to my fiancee or refunded but it wasn't!!!!!\n",
      "97. Western have blocked my money going through for a second time. They say my phone might be hacked.I log into Western with a 6 digit number then log into banking app and end a different 6digit number and to confirm the transaction I enter the code for the bank again, so when I go to western to get my MCN number they told me they blocked the transaction. Extremely frustrated is an understatement. And to top it off they holding MY money for 5 days. Won't be using them again. Found another app with half the price charge. Come on Western pull your finger out.\n",
      "98. I don’t like having limits. If I didn’t have the money to send, I would not try to send. Its damn inconvenient when I need to use the service and I can’t\n",
      "99. 9 days to transfer my money.\n",
      "100. The login page is very slow at times and times out.\n",
      "101. Too complicated to send money these days ,especially sending to Jamaica.Extremely stressful if sending even $600 $usd\n",
      "102. I like the ease of transfer at an onsite location but I am very disappointed with transfer of money from home from both the length of time it took to send the money and the fact that it is more expensive\n",
      "103. You guys give hard working people hard time to do business with you guys\n",
      "104. To much of a hassle when sending money to love ones ill never use western union again\n",
      "105. It had been some time since I last logged on to send money to my son in Virginia.  I found that I could not access the special code that you required.  I tried several times and finally gave up and went to the local Stop & Shop and had them send the money.  Totally unhappy!\n",
      "106. I made 2 transactions this month. 1st was great! 2nd disappointing. wI changed me for the 2nd one but no for the 1st. Can someone explained me what happen!?\n",
      "107. Western Union is nothing but a scam. I got money orders with the intent to deposit into my bank account as mine is not local all for it to suddenly be prohibited. When I tried to return the money orders, my information is suddenly lost within the system and now I’m out of over $1k. This is extremely unprofessional and no one has been able to help. I will never service with western union again because it is all a scam\n",
      "108. Takes 4 days at times to transfer money so earlier it was my go to but now cannot rely on WU for emergency fund transfer. Looking for other platforms for a faster transfer.\n",
      "109. Sending money every weekI want to cancel a transaction y’all don’t let me & make me loose my money 👎👎👎👎👎👎\n",
      "110. Impossible to use WESTERN UNION from my desk top computer. Simply does not work.\n",
      "111. Making relatively high profit on the exchange rate when there’s already a remittance fee for transactions.\n",
      "112. Terrible customer careBad listening and understanding\n",
      "113. Customer service doesn’t have enough experience what they are doing\n",
      "114. The store didn't have money. Required multiple visits to receive cash.\n",
      "115. The exchange rate is to high for the country of Jordan, I'm paying for 9% on top of the exchange rate! Xzoom is cheaper!\n",
      "116. I had stipulated payout in USD as my wife was flying back to the USA via Vancouver. She tried several outlets in Manila but none would pay out in dollars.\n",
      "117. I tried several times but was not successful to transfer money this time. The message says I need to go to Western Union branch for transfer.\n",
      "118. my money is no delivery yet and this fir medical emergency\n",
      "119. Long waiting time.\n",
      "120. Overall Western Union service is okay. If sending bank to bank it’s a good value. If sending bank to in person pickup, it is getting to be expensive.\n",
      "121. Your service is shit want my money back\n",
      "122. I am with western union since 10 yrs.have lots of rewards point .I can t use it .one of the stupidity  programs. Can't use it in walmart  where fees r lower than any other places.\n",
      "123. Western Union is always a great source to send money abroad.  This time, the funds were held for 5 or six days where the receiver could not access it immediately.  I was a little frustrating, especially since the funds were for a specific purpose.\n",
      "124. I have experience when i send money to Peru, i sent in dollars money they dont want to give in dollars want to give in solo, but 4 points less how is in the market\n",
      "125. You guys do a good job, but I am so sick and tired of having to call you every time. My wife is with her parents and he’s dying. They are on a poor country. She lives on the US with me. But because they don’t have much money, I send it too my wife often. I appreciate you protecting got fraud. But I’m way pass needing to have to call every dang time.\n",
      "126. I never received a card. The whole point was to not have to leave the house like I’m about to have to in a little while. I don’t want to send money. I want to receive it every week and not pay a taxi $30 to take me to pick it up.\n",
      "127. Resend has got a lot more complicated I’m thinking of finding another sever\n",
      "128. Je ne parviens plus à faire un transfert comme avant\n",
      "129. Very dissapointing that the time to deliver funds to the recipient keeps bouncing from few hours to 7 days!. For some of us users having the certainty of a timeframe helps us to program our transactions to meet the needs of other people who rely on the money.\n",
      "130. Big queue....took over 30 minutes to get my money\n",
      "131. My last transfer was bad experience i sent to receiver bank account but something happened wrong and receiver has to received cash at agents\n",
      "132. I’ve sent money yesterday on mobile money transfer to clear my goods at the harbour till today the money didn’t arrive and I’ve called them today they told me that the money will take 2 working days what is all this about?\n",
      "133. Bad service plz don't send money through western union, this service is not like before secondly phone number is not working, I sent money 2nd July 2025 ,today is 9th of July my receiver didn't get money still,western union is very bad service i will put case through my solicitor against this company to get my money back\n",
      "134. This time wasn't good. I sent money on Saturday and Sunday for same day receive but my receiver received money on Tuesday 😔\n",
      "135. I transferred my money on June 23 and still haven’t had a refund or my customer has not received it\n",
      "136. It said 2-3 days or less to transfer but the money is still not in my account ...\n",
      "137. Very disappointed\n",
      "138. Service unavailable. Please try again later.\n",
      "139. It's fast service to send the money. But it's high charging fee in every transaction.\n",
      "140. I was intending to transfer the money into my receipint bank account which I couldn't because you didn't give me this option,  you only insisted on cash pickup,  the area of my receipint has no western union facilities. I had to cancel the transfer and went to other company who did it perfectly.  I was disappointed by your company's persistency in the one way of delivering.\n",
      "141. When I tried on Friday I was unable to complete the transaction because an annoying pop-up explaining what the number on the back of the card was which prevented the entry of the actual number. By Saturday morning all was back to normal.\n",
      "142. Not good service. Next day delivery took 5 days but still not delivered.\n",
      "143. I don't speak French and the info is always in French.I did not get my money back from WU. I did not get any answer to my mail.\n",
      "144. After 2 hours of completing all the necessary steps and paying them the money through bank transfer, I received an email to say that the transaction has been cancelled without giving any reason that why was it cancelled?  This is not the first time that it happened with Western Union.  I send money to my family in Pakistan every month and I have had no problem with REMITLY.  Today, after many months, I decided to use Western Union as the rates were a little bit better but wasted nearly 2 hours of my time.  Now I have to wait \"up to 7 days\" to get my money back. Terrible service.  At least they should give you a reason as to why your transaction was cancelled and why did they not try again. Or there should be an instant refund so we can use other methods to send money.  What if someone was desperate for those funds on the other side of the world?\n",
      "145. You don't respect customers. I referred someone who is using WU, but never I got my reward. I only received a link asking me to claim my rewards, and it has too many questions, too many protocols. I believe it is just to piss off me otherwise a different way could be chosen. I felt abused.\n",
      "146. I transferred the money to my fiancées bank in Thailand, but for whatever reason your system transferred it to one of your offices to collect in person, which is no where near to where she lives. So she had to close her salon,losing custom and travel into the local town to collect.\n",
      "147. All worked well then I get told my transfer limit has reached and no longer able to transfer. Who sets limits i didn't now they want me to upload shedloads of documents to be able to use them. They already have a copy of my passport. It's a small monetary transfer, not even over £100. Cannot recommend for regular transfers.\n",
      "148. The system says the money is ready but local office had no cash and told me to return tomorrow. This happens often. It’s frustrating when you need the money fast.\n",
      "149. Rate not goodExtra fees for each time changeVery badI am uea long time Western UnionNow going other company much batter rate and fees free\n",
      "150. Tried to pick up money from my brother in UK. The office here didn’t have USD and asked me to come back next day. Not the first time. This is a serious issue in Iraq.\n",
      "151. It took Western Union eight days to deliver the funds to Ethiopia. By the time the money was received, the exchange rate had changed. However, the system still showed the delivery date as the same day the transaction was initiated. There was no clear or adequate explanation provided regarding the so-called technical issue.Customer service was particularly disappointing. The representatives came across as entitled and unhelpful, repeating scripted responses without addressing my actual concerns—one even disconnected the call abruptly. As for email support, they failed to respond altogether.It is deeply frustrating and disheartening that an international company would provide such poor service. The experience left me feeling as though I was dealing with a scam rather than a reputable financial institution.\n",
      "152. It is worst transfer app. Always put money on hold for 2 3 days. If anybody have an emergency to whom he is sending money then what he can do. Customer service is also shit. They put the call on hold for 20-30 long minutes. I made two transactions, in both they stuck my money. I will never going to use it again.\n",
      "153. Transfer took nearly a week to reach recipient and I did not get any explanation for the delay. This never used to be the case in the past, but this year every attempt transfer I have made has either not completed due to unexplained technical matters or delayed as explained above\n",
      "154. I went twice last week to Euro money shop in Woodgreen Shopping city N22 on both occasions computer system for western union was downWent to 31 High Road n22 deplorable service poor communication skills from assistant could not explain why I only got 201 Jamaica dollars for the pound whenJamaica National was paying 217.I was most unhappy with admin charge was over £8.00 to send 400 pounds to Jamaica the variance in charge and dollars for pound is too vast .I will stick in future to Jamaica national.\n",
      "155. Found better rate and been send money long time and get no rewards\n",
      "156. Could not deliver a bank because it's not on your list 😒\n",
      "157. Extremely difficult to send with WesternUnion, they changed the way they do transfers and not easy anymore\n",
      "158. I  send  money   to   Thailand   for    years\n",
      "159. I paid for minute dispacth and they got money one day late\n",

      "162. If comparing Wiht money gram and ria western union is too expensive always\n",
      "163. Your rates are not the same as they should be,causing more fees,I spoke to one of your guys and was fobbed off.if you dont sort your rates out I wont be using you again.ive started using XE,a £3.00 fee and the rates almost identical. Your going to lose a lot of customers. Bye bye\n",
      "164. After years of collecting now the middle name becomes an issue\n",
      "165. Restrictive and lengthy questions as to recipients and source of funds - now only allowed one transaction a day. WU competitors are benefitting from these increased obstacles\n",
      "166. I sent two transfers to go through receivers  bank a/c in India. Instead of I got a message to say it's ready for pickup. Phone your customer service 3 times over two weeks periods they told me it's a technical error. Surely western union is a big company and it's still not shorted. The receivers lives in villages they have to go long way to collect the money from agents and it has caused a lot of difficulty to both receivers\n",
      "167. There’s an office that takes a 1% commission, and I think this is fraud.\n",
      "168. Unable to send from app and not many western union places in my area\n",
      "169. I can easily transfer in the browser, but I dislike that I always have problems with transfers in the app. I cannot get transfers approved via the Norwegian BankID.\n",
      "170. I sent money over a week ago, receiver never got the money and I'm yet to get a refund. Poor customers services\n",
      "171. Not very reliable,it's not the first option.Reason being, some transactions don't go through on time. They delay arrival even for days. Refunds take long. It also rejects some really registered mobile money wallets.It doesn't off to send to an alternative number in case the first one fails\n",
      "172. Nigeria recipient  unable to access funds despite correct documentation. Western Union has suspended operations with  bank  payout.  Also poor refunds as  was paid over the counter. Quick to receive not quick to pay back!Online customer service  slow to respond.\n",
      "173. charges are high . used to charge £2.99 for £2,000 tranxaction. now £8\n",
      "174. I sent the money direct to the Bank account of my sister as I always did, but she did not receive it. Instead she had received a message via viber on her phone that she needs to pick it up from Western Union.\n",
      "175. Horrible. They dont even pickup the phon and they dont even reply back ro the emails. I never had this issue but now when i needed the most they didnt reapond to any of my emails and any of my calls.\n",
      "176. Not a WU problem.aa such but trying to collect money in Nigeria is almost impossible.Even in Lagos the banks don't want to hand over the money without answering some very personal questions.Finally one bank agreed to give the recipient the money but only after they opened an account with the bank.\n",
      "177. The customer wasn’t allowed to pick up the money in Jamaica. If the customer has the right ID with correct name they shouldn’t  be refused collection or be judged. I believe there should be more training done to help the business grow.\n",
      "178. Transferring money to Syria is high\n",
      "179. Very bad service\n",
      "180. Communicatie\n",
      "181. Why do I have to always look for a store to complete my transaction. I used to do everything on line before. Now I get a prompt to go to the nearest store. I may as well just go to the store to complete the transaction\n",
      "182. You charge 2much.\n",
      "183. I had to wait for too long and then they said there is something wrong with the system and I waited my time\n",
      "184. Not good, I have sent money 2 or 3 times and then 4 times it’s error\n",
      "185. I have been trying to send money to my wife who was unable to exchange our local currency at the airports when she flew.  So she arrived in a country that she has never been before with very little local currency to get by.  Luckily, she already has a place to stay where they provide her with food.Giving our money to Western Union was easy.  The online payment system, choosing all the options of who you want to send the money to, where, and how ... is all smooth.  So they get their money quickly.However, when my wife tried to pick up cash from the agent that we found on Western Union's website telling us that my wife needed to go there with her government issued ID and the tracking number to fill out a form and collect cash, the agent (at Wal Mart) was incredibly unkind to her and refused to give her the cash that Western Union was so happy to take from us.The cashier only said that she could deposit it into a bank account if my wife provided her with a debit card ... back to where the money was coming from!!!  What use is that?If I could give Western Union a 0-star review I would, because what is the point in having a company that helps you to send money around the world if they don't let you collect it at the location where they told you to collect it from when you have done everything that they told you to do??\n",
      "186. - 1 OUT OF 10- EXCHANGE RATE\n",
      "187. (App) 2/4 times my money got frozen for 1-2 days. If the transfer is not going thru they will not tell you. If u talk with the support they can’t do nothing like for example unblock the transfer and making it go thru. You have to cancel by yourself and hope it will work the next time beside the fact that you have to wait a few days to get back your money. The app i would not recommend. Only in the stores\n",
      "188. Could not input info on app items blocked and therefore confusion causing the payment to be made twice? Poor system\n",
      "189. I am very disappointed with western union money transfer. I must also say this is my second one in the last 5 years, but when it comes to money, I think there must not be even one such experience.So on this occasion I made a small fund transfer to a bank account internationally on the 3rd of July for an elderly person. WUMT promises customers that the money will arrive the recipient’s account in maximum of 1-2 working days. Third day I contacted WUMT as the money is held at their branch and they have asked recipient to go to their branch in person to collect the cash, despite the transaction was to a international bank account.The customer service agent on the telephone conversation promised me on the 5th that, they have raised a complaint as there seem some technical issues in WUMT and that caused this issue where my money is held by them in their branch to be collected in person. I was also promised their complaints team will contact me in 24 hours.The best thing is that 1) their technical issues has not seemed to have resolved until now, whilst I am writing this review and MY MONEY IS WITH THEM, also they have charged me extra for this transfer. 2) the complaints team haven’t bothered to contact me even after 29 hours.So the conclusion is - I made my very last transaction with WUMT on the 3rd of this month. Having said that I want my money back, including the fees I paid ASAP with compensation for all the inconveniences caused and I will never ever recommend WUMT to anyone in future regardless of any benefits they will have to offer.Other customers please be aware of such potential issues that you could face in the future.Thank you\n",
      "190. The thing is that at some point WU was ok but since a couple of months ago ...it's not working anymore\n",
      "191. Website is awful. Extremely slow and gets lost in navigation. Coupons initially applied, are not recognized later. Many times, you have to start the whole process again.\n",
      "192. I gave 1 star because this app is not loyal so I sent money to Afghanistan it changed £1 for 89 Afghanis and at the same time my husband sent £1 for 92 Afghanis It’s theaf\n",
      "193. This company is going the wrong way, trying to receive money is so challenging because most places that work with western union do not pay, only receive money, went to 7 places, wasted half a day to get paid, additionally the exchange rate is super bad, I lost at least $300 in a $3500 transfer\n",
      "194. I am now on my 7th attempt to pick up money. And its not going well so far. Computers this time. Its expensive and way too hard to be useful. App is good and the service internationally has been good. But not in california.\n",
      "195. L application il est très long à s ouvrir\n",
      "196. I sent money to Australia 10 days ago and it has not yet arrived.  Enquired at the local office on July 1st who were very helpful but still the money has not arrived. Sent an email three days ago but no response.\n",
      "197. This is the worst money transfer I have seen in my life. I did twice giving them a benefit of doubt that it will be relaible and fast. No way. I sent money on 29th June and now 5th of July it is not in progress. What is this system. They first said please check your bank it is being delayed in my bank, RBC Royal Bank of Canada does not delay. Despite that I went to the bank, they said money has already been deducted gone... Now I am in phone with one customer agent, he says let me check... and gone for a few minutes. I am wondering how many people experience such negligence and delays. Now the Western Union has money for a few days... it is sitting on it. How many millions of dollars do they keep for days without interest? It is a really absurd. Sujata\n",
      "198. I have transfer using Western Union, after transferring I got emil that money on hold and under review .It's been two days , receiver still did not got the money, I have tried to call Western Union , but seems there is problems with their phone line .also sent email , still waiting for response.\n",
      "199. The will hold your money for very long time claiming you are suspicious person and they ask for IDs and history of work even though the transaction was originated from a trust bank. I did all what they wanted and the transaction continued to be on hold. If you complain they will claim that your name is matching someone who is suspicious even though they have all the documents and they already did the verification so many times. They act as if they are the only transfer service in the market while there are many alternatives. It is just false advertising that the transaction will arrive imidiatly. This explains why western union is losing its market shares. Even investors are getting rid of the stock due to the unresponsable treatment of the customers. It will never be reliable service when you have to go through the verification every time you use the service. My conclusion that western union intend to hold your money for the longest period with the exercise of verification even if you are already verified.\n",
      "200. Good service\n",
      "201. I requested two money transfers (02072025 & 03072025) to my dependants  (for their food, housing, education and other essential needs) in Nigeria and they have not received them up till now - Friday, 04072025.\n",
      "202. Every now and then should get a decent discount\n",
      "203. Truly! Western Union is the worse company anyone can use to send money. Just read about my experience:I went on their website to send $100.00 to a friend in the Dominican Republic. Despite I have an account with them for about 20 years, after providing me with the tracking number and charging my bank they place the transaction pending. My friend in DR had to turn back home because of course they said the transaction was pending. I contacted them and they told me I need it to send an USA I to prove I was a legit customer and not an scammer. After expressing my frustration I had no choice, either I do it or leave the $100.00 in their bank. They sent me a link to upload both sides of my driver license. It took about 40 minutes due to the malfunction of their system.  After I was able to upload my information they sent me an email telling me \"Your money transfer is available for payout (Tracking Number xxxxx) Is not guaranteed that this will be a walk in the park because at one point I went through the process of retiring some non paid money and I had to go to different western union locations and call customer service many time before I was paid.You would think that instead of creating me the other inconvenience of having to go into a line and an claim my money that instead they would had issue a credit through my credit card? No they did not care for my time at all.To conclude: They don't care if you waste your time, and they won't make it any easy to refund your money, I feel so agrivated and will delete my account and will ever again use Western Union to send money. I would rather send my money with a pigeon instead.The question is can anyone put a price to the aggravation. Not worth it. To concludes I should say Western Union really sucks.\n",
      "204. I was scammed by a person who offered me a swervice and asked me to send money by western union. When I reported the case to them, they simply did nothing. That's bad.\n",
      "205. They were ok until about 2 months ago when they started asking for a national ID of the sender and receiver and then a copy of the invoice for what the purchase was for. After providing all that they still could not send the money for reasons which they refused to provide to me.\n",
      "206. I like the fact that you can both send cash at the post office and send money online this is good. But they ask totally stupid questions, every time you send money, even with your online account, with all your person info on that account, they still ask repeatedly ask stupid questions none stop every time you send money. WHY? The same stupid questions every time. How many times do you need to answer the same stupid question? And the other thing is if you try complaining about something to customer services, well that's like talking to a brick wall, they have no, completely no comprehension of English and English sentences.  like talking to a brick wall and you get nowhere with your complaint, they don't understand your complaint never mind even trying to resolve it. customer services are worse than rubbish.\n",
      "207. Il faut sans cesse recommencer. Et maintenant il n accepted plus la carte\n",
      "208. Usually this is a first class service and im a regular customer,  for some reason today,  very unsatisfactory,  the receiver had to go to a specific bank, unlike usual,  very inconvenient\n",
      "209. I wanted to claim a 50% discount on your charges using the points I had accumulated. I tried doing this three times on the Italian website and was told each time that there was a technical problem and to try again later. As I was in a hurry, I eventually gave up and paid the full price. However, I feel that WU has cheated me.\n",

      "11. I’ve been a loyal Wise user and never violated any of their terms. Suddenly, I received an email saying my account was permanently closed — without any detailed reason or chance to clarify. I’ve always used the platform responsibly, provided all documents when requested, and have nothing to hide.What’s most frustrating is the lack of transparency and communication. I reached out for a manual review but received a generic response saying they can’t disclose more. This experience has left me feeling unfairly treated and concerned about how decisions are being made.I used Wise for important personal/business payments, and now I’ve been forced to scramble for alternatives. I understand Wise has compliance responsibilities, but customers deserve clearer communication and a chance to be heard.Really disappointed — I hope Wise improves how it handles such cases and treats customers with more respect.\n",
      "12. Very poor communication, they did everything to close my account for no reason. They didn't respond to my requests for explanations. In short, a dictatorship.\n",
      "13. Disaster serviceFirst you open the account and after you put money in account and start using it they start asking for documents for your source of wealth proof of addressIn my case they had returned the money of a transfer I was receiving and after 4 days sending them documents they I asked and with out a valid reason they closed my account\n",
      "14. It was impossible to setup the account using through my phone, using Firefox, since it could take the selfie even though being able to take the document photos. That's fine, even if their UX was horrible and deadlocked at this stage. What  I don't like is that is also impossible to fully delete the account, since I now have no use for it. You can only disable it, and after doing this you get a mail with a link to what is supposed to be information about how long your data will be stored. This link is behind a login page, so you can only read the information meant for customer that has closed their account if they reactive their account. The only other way to contact them about getting your account fully deleted is by calling the customer service, which is not a free number. There you will put on hold and see your money tick away, only to get to know that they don't have a standard process for this. Following GDPR much?\n",
      "15. Terrible. Finds ways to charge you for simplest transactions. Then doesn't work. I needed to make a purchase after eating their exchange rate. They blocked it numerous times and did not let me do a crucial payment. Will never use again after years of using.\n",
      "16. They say you can transfer to Ukraine, which is in fact not true. They sanction payments to Ukrainian bank cards if a person lives next to the front although still on Ukrainian side, which is total nonsense.\n",
      "17. Absolutely ridiculous. Today I opened an account with Wise, topped it up from my card, and got my account details. Everything seemed fine — until I tried to link Wise to my PayPal.PayPal sent ONE PENNY to verify the account — and Wise didn’t even show it to me. Then, out of nowhere, an hour later, THEY CLOSED MY ACCOUNT.Seriously? Just for linking PayPal and receiving a penny? What’s the point of Wise if it can’t even handle a basic account verification? This is wild. Totally useless and untrustworthy. Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "18. Hold on to afew of my transaction and told me never received but DBS bank clearly stated already transferred over. And after showing wise Cust service what DBS shown me, she closed my account. I am going to lodge another police report tomorrow about Wise scamming my money\n",
      "19. Wise closed my account. I don't know why and don't plan to appeal because based on this limited experience they are 100% not a company I'd want to do business with in the future. The problem is, I'm still waiting on Wise to return the small payments I made that didn't reach their receiver. I don't see how this could be viewed as anything but fraud on Wise's part. I paid them for a service - transferring money to another Wise account - and they decided not to provide me with that service but also haven't refunded my money. There is really no way to view this other than simply fraud on the part of Wise.If anyone is reading this, you do have options: if you're in the states (like I am) file complaints with your state Department of Commerce. Also file one with the CFPB. And then call your state attorney general's office and ask if you can file a complaint with them directly or if they can refer you to other services.It's also possible to file a complaint in the UK with ActionFraud. Please do so! It's likely the best option for receiving money back that Wise has scammed from however many people they've scammed money from. And it's important to file these complaints because the more complaints that are officially filed the higher the likelihood that some governmental agency will take action against Wise and hopefully stop them from committing fraud against other unsuspecting victims.\n",
      "20. i already booking an appointment with Cantoment Sg Police Station IO Azman (anti scam dept) , and  going to update him bout you terminating my account in Wise where you hold on so much transaction of mine and say missing.  it’s ok to terminate the account as i have screen recording of our previous conversation .Sent from my iPhone\n",
      "21. Unlike every other financial institution, Wise has made the decision to charge customers who have changed their name for a replacement card to match their identity and new forms of identification. This practice is short-sighted and does not take into account the many reasons why people change their names. I found their customer service team to be completely clueless about the basics of customer service when I raised my concerns with them.Of course, when I went to close my account there was yet another plea to let them solve the problem. Why is this always the case? Care about customers the first time they interact with you. You have one chance, not many.\n",
      "22. Funds take far too long to appear in the balance, despite leaving your account immediately. Often a day or two of waiting. Very inconvenient.\n",

Despite providing the information requested, I haven't received my funds due to a technical issue. Additionally, I'm facing challenges with the refund process, as Wise has indicated a problem but hasn't clarified the specific issue. Could you please assist me in resolving this?\n",

June 2025 about a sudden inactivation and then closure of my Wise account on 2 June 2025.I decided to close my account but had to go through a complaints procedure to get something of an active response, BUTI complained on the 23 June 2025 (Reference No : 39037861) asking for a full final copy of my Wise account statement (as no longer directly accessible to me) and transfer of the positive balance to my account by postal cheque.I received a reply 7th July 2025, having to send a selfie with photo ID card before the outcome of the 'investigation' is being sent. I did so.They then insisted that I send a bank statement for proof of account as they' doo not use postal cheques', but I believe that this is excessive and has its own security risk.Instead I sent a selfie on the same day, holding my bank card with account and sort code visible.I finally did decide to send a bank statement on the 16 July 2025, but I had no acknowledgement or reply to this email, in other words the email trail about my complaint has gone stone-cold on Wise's side.I can only assume that complaints either have a low priority or there are too many complaints for the existing team to handle....So after 7 weeks, endless emails, 2 phone calls (that achieved nothing) and a complaint following the sudden freeze and closure of my account by Wise (2nd June 2025), Wise is still sitting on my money.\n",
      "27. Day 13 of missing money and still no sign of it arriving with the recipient.Amongst lots of emails and countless phone calls chasing the missing payment they have admitted an error on their part but still I have no money. I still have to wait.This is how they operate:“Our partner bank has sent us an update regarding your transfer.There were some technical changes done to the network that was processing your transfer and since those changes were not completed at the time the transfer was submitted, it needed more time to be completed.Could you please check with your recipient if they have since received the payment into their account? It should have arrived by now.”We still don’t have it and I still have to wait.The whole process is a farce. We all know money transfers are immediate. I cannot establish why they are not sending this money over.Don’t be fooled by a good service initially, it’s all good until it goes wrong then it goes wrong spectacularly.I decided to raise a formal complaint. I was appointed someone one by the name of Rekha, guess what, no response there either.This is so stressful and worrying and they simply don’t care.See other 1 star reviews before you trust your money with this lot.I have reported them to RIP Off Britain and Martin Lewis. The Financial Ombudsman will be notified today. If anyone else has a similar story please do the same. Let’s raise awareness on this awful service to stop others suffering.\n",
      "28. I have been a happy Wise customer for many years and trusted them.However, while I was temporarily abroad and had planned to use their services, Wise closed my account suddenly without giving any warning or notice. They were not providing any reason other than referring to their terms and conditions, which allows them to act even on suspicions. And they don't provide you with a reason for their action, even if you ask them. They also don't refund your Debit if you have one with them. Don't rely on them!!\n",
      "29. My payment has been delayed for many days. The system is constant under maintenance, no calls from support teams and no confirmation on why my payment is taking so long. All for a very small transaction amount.\n",
      "30. I have been using Wise to pay my programmers who live overseas... but recently, they keep requesting info from me like bank statements, bank account, business license, LLC docs, tax info... I have submitted all of that (been in business since 1995)... and they have \"blocked\" me from paying my programmers... saying they need to \"verify\" my info and \"we have all the info\" like huh?\n",
      "31. Not approving govt. issued tax ID as valid document\n",
      "32. Before the transfer, Wise says there are no fees. However, the recipient receives €35 less, which isn't shown on any invoice. At first, support said it was the fee charged by the receiving bank. After checking the receiving bank, I found out they charged about €5. Wise support then told me that the fees were charged by third-party banks with which Wise works to process Swift transfers. This platform is not trustworthy and has hidden costs.\n",
      "33. You block a very important transaction.\n",
      "34. I cannot recommend Wise. They fully exploit the stated timeframe of 2–5 days before crediting funds, even though the money was sent the same day via an express transfer from my bank.Wise’s excuse is that the intermediary banks take that long, and they claim to be doing everything possible to provide a pleasant experience for the customer.However, small amounts are credited within minutes – conveniently.I am very dissatisfied, as the support team replies anonymously and cannot tell me when exactly my money will arrive. In 2025! And the customer is left guessing whether everything is running smoothly.So yes – Wise might be okay for pocket-money transfers, but in my opinion, it’s not suitable for anything beyond that.Also, there are recurring errors in the stock investment plan credits. You really need to stay alert everywhere.\n",
      "35. Signed a deal with big cellphone distribution company, that unfortunately uses \"Wise\" for their transfers.  \"Wise\", has intensive and intrusive security entry protocols that make utilizing this service, more difficult than you think.  Annoyingly difficult, borderline control mechanised company.So, I am forced to go through their security detail, even though I am only sending money to the distributors.Setting this up is not an easy task, it really isn't.Firstly as an example, if you want to use your driving licence as your ID. You are told to take a picture of the front of the driving licence, then a picture of the back of the driving licence.First bit, no problems, uploaded.The second bit, there appears to be a major glitch on the Wise website / platform, that basically is forcing the camera to turn around, rather than facing downwards, in order to take the photo required.It makes no logical sense why they would want a picture of the back of your driving licence either. The only information on the back of a UK driving licence, is what car you can drive, as in its code.So baffled as to why it is demanded a copy of the back of your driving licence is required.But I cannot take picture of the back of the driving licence anyway, because the \"Wise\" camera, refuses to point downwards, which means trying to take a picture of something, pointing the phone camera down, does not work at all.Disappointed with this \"Wise\". Another payments system that is riddled with security protocol, control mechanisms and poorly executed again.So I now have orders that have been paid for on Ebay, that are not going to be honoured, because of \"Wise\".This causes a massive issue. I do not recommend any company to use \"Wise\".Just use regular payment systems, like \"Paypal\", who are not much better, but at least you have not got to take photos of yourselves every-time you want to send a payment.Your security detail is too intrusive, for the product you offer, which is a basic money transfer service.Not even Paypal has such ridiculous measures, and they are pretty backwards, in all honesty.Thanks for causing me much stress, thanks for being ignorant and I recommend that you somehow go bankrupt in the near future, so to force the company I am dealing with to use another provider for their money transfers.Do not respond with the usual, we are right and you are wrong replies, that companies always seem to put on Trustpilot. NO, I am not interested in anything you have to say.You are an inefficiently set up organisation that should be removed from the public domain.Thank you.\n",
      "36. The overall ergonomics could be better and the user interface could be more user friendly.\n",
      "37. I have been using Wise for over 10 years because of jobs I have had in different parts of the world. I have been a very loyal customer and have recommended Wise to many individuals. Some time ago they changed their policies to take away guaranteed rates if you had too many cancelled transactions. I complied with the new policy to get my guaranteed rate back, which I did through many more transfers. However, despite this, they have taken away my guaranteed rate again even when I have consistently gone through with all transfers immediately. I don’t understand why except that I created a lone duplicate transfer (out of more than 10 - and of course they gave me the lower rate when I made the singular transfer). They took away the guaranteed rate again, which for my last transfer somehow left me with the lowest rate over the entire week. When businesses grow, customer loyalty goes out the window. I have probably made over 50 transfers with their company. I feel disappointed now with their policy of suspending the guaranteed rate capriciously.\n",
      "38. I was genuinely delighted with Wise and the overall quality of its service. However, discovering how sensitively the system reacts to international transfers—and how uncertain the reactivation process can be—has taken away much of my motivation to continue using Wise.I fully understand the importance of compliance with Wise’s usage guidelines. Still, deactivating an entire account due to a suspicious transaction—without offering a clear explanation or time frame—significantly diminishes the value of an otherwise excellent product.Suggestions for Improvement:1. Block or reject specific suspicious transactions—ideally with a brief explanation—rather than deactivating the entire account. Locking users out of their full account and credit balance can cause serious financial hardship, especially when the wrong people are affected.2. Engage with the customer before deactivation. A serious financial institution would first seek a conversation to understand the context, rather than making irreversible decisions based on automated flags alone.3. Provide transparent reasoning. If the only explanation given is a vague reference to a “breach of usage policy,” customers are left guessing. It’s nearly impossible to defend or appeal a decision without understanding what exactly triggered it.4. Ensure reactivation is as fast as deactivation. It’s extremely stressful to rely on funds held with Wise and then face a total account freeze—without any guarantee or timeline for when access will be restored.If Wise were to take some of the more desperate Trustpilot reviews to heart, rather than defending or rationalizing this questionable strategy, it could easily evolve into the perfect product. The foundation is already strong—what’s needed is more transparency, communication, and customer trust during edge-case scenarios.\n",
      "39. I have just made a large transaction that doesn't show on my account; therefore, I cannot send the proof of my payment to the recepient. It is all very urgent and causes me unnecessary stress. There is no phone number to call unless you live in the USA, no email to to found—very poor way to treat your customers.\n",
      "40. Be very careful. They are hiding GDPR breaches of customers data.I had two unauthorized transaction with a plastic card issued by them and never used for any transactions.Immediately after that saw that my phone is used for some registrations for crypto platforms.I have contacted Wise with my concerns but they refuse any information about this. I can see some more posts here from people having the same experience.Probably I will close my account.\n",
      "41. no online troubleshooting chat available\n",
      "42. I have used Wise since 2016 and while it used to be my go-to place for currency exchange, the quality has dropped dramatically in the recent years. The fees are not clear and the customer service is a disaster: My business account's virtual card got hacked without any prior history and I was losing money on my account for some random website in Philippines. Luckily, I saw the incident realtime so was able to freeze the card and prevent the biggest damage. 6 months and dozens of messages later I still haven't got any explanation why this happened and my virtual card history just got wiped out to destroy the evidence. It looked like they had some bug in their virtual cards and I lost my trust on that moment and moved everything away from Wise.Another poor experience was when I opened my paid business account assuming I'd be able to get local US bank details and credit card payment option for my clients. 1.5 years and several requests later neither of these have happened so don't assume you will be able to get the features they are marketing.If you're a business owner, do yourself a favor and check out amnis which has actual humans in customer service and where your money is insured up to 100k. Unlike Wise, it provides you local bank details instantly for several countries (including US) and they are continuously  adding new features as well.\n",
      "43. too restricteddo not block the ratelack of transparency\n",
      "44. Illegal harassment at the top at this place. Blocked my money even after all the information I provided. First they refused to accept that my money was already been into their account, then they demanded all personal information regarding the sender which is unlawful act and breach of public privacy. At least it proved that the money was sitting into their account but they didn’t want to pay me. They are using people’s money for their personal use and try to hold onto it as long as they can. The people sitting at the top positions lending money personally to the underworld black market with high interest rates. That’s actually money belongs to people like me. They circulate public funds to gain personal benefits when they’re not allowed to touch that money. They use term ‘regulated financial services’ to buy more and more time on the name of ‘additional information required’. A local bank transfers take only few minutes to get to and from the banks. These people taking 2-5 working days not because they haven’t received the money but because they are too greedy to use the money to generate illegal incomes. Don’t use them. If question them they’ll get accelerate their harassment and make you wait and suffer more and more. I regret using them. Stay away from scammers.\n",
      "45. Absolutely shocking and still cannot trace my money. Wise keep requesting a bank statement from the company I sent money to. Err, of.course they are not going to provide this.Wise said they cannot do anything else without this statement. Great.\n",
      "46. On this week I got scammed 2 times and the wise in about 15 mins decided my transactions are legit.I didnt even could explain what happened.I think Im going to change Bank account now even if I have to pay yearly card fees.Dont trust them.They dont care about the fraud transactions they just ok those.Didnt even helped when I called them.The guy just said the wise agreed this transaction in 10mins as this is a legit site :D.I tried to google Future technologies SA.But I didnt find anything.So the Wise just let scams to do with you and Im 50Euros less.Good luck with them guys\n",
      "47. I’ve tried adding funds with 2 different debit cards, a bank account and Apple Pay with O results. Customer service reads a scripted response with an accent that is very difficult to understand. No help at all as well as sending an email with screen shots as requested, now they want another method to add funds a wire transfer the most expensive\n",
      "48. Wide blocked my account and when I try to unblock it, they say they now have the info required but then when I go back, same message: blocked. Nobody helps! They are hopeless\n",
      "49. Is Wise still a trustable business? I have been using it for multiples years and I was even recommending it. But this year, I’m getting really “scared” by how they are doing business.For the second time this year, they asked for my business documents and I sent it at the moment of the request. The issue? They put a block on the account until they review the documents and even blocked the card so all normal payments dont work.Talking with the support, she was not helpful and only pastting legal copy to tell me to wait for 48hSo, they have my money, ask documents (that they already have) and block the full account (withouy any reason or crazy new moviment in the account).This time, I’m really rethinking the use of Wise in my business and life, and starting considering that I should use Revolut and ignore Wise … and for sure I’m not recommending it anymore, as looks like its not safe to use it.Edit: I got a weird automated reply from Wise team on the Google review.Be aware, it’s getting almost clear that Wise can’t be trusted anymore.PS: this all happened after I requested the creation of a new business account here in Czech Republic, paid 1150czk (50usd) to open accounts, and after it all I just closed it without use as I cant trust Wise anymore (and of course they took the payment as a gift).Stay away if you care about your money.\n",
      "50. The fee is too high for transferring money from same currency! I transferred from SEK to SEK. The fee to ad money to my account ( USD to USD) is also high.\n",
      "51. Long standing and previously v happy Wise customer but trying to move USD from a UK bank account to a travel agent in Kenya seemed impossible - ended up reconfiguring my account to the extent it's now near enough unusable.\n",
      "52. When you search the web for setting your Wise account as your default account to receive e-transfer payments, there are clear instructions to do it. However, after I open the account, I simply couldn't set my Wise account as the default account to receive money. I called the support, they couldn't give an answer and had to get back to me through an email. I got the email later and they said I just couldn't receive money through e-transfer. There is a chance that I could do it later on.So, if you open a Wise account and hope something would work, don't count on it. There are lots of instabilities currently. I also feel that their preferred way to add money to the account is quite sketchy. You have to provide your bank card number and the password to Wise. My bank simply doesn't allow me to do that and forced me to change the password. Something for you to consider before you open a Wise account.The following is an update after Wise's reply. Wise implied that e-transfer is not supported in certain countries like Canada. This indicates that the person who replied have not done any research. My friend has a Wise account, and he can set his Wise account as the default receiver for e-transfer. Wise definitely supports e-transfer in Canada. This reply is typical of Wise's support.\n",
      "53. I changed my address from Macedonia to Germany to receive a Wise card while working abroad. Support told me I could verify my account with official German documents like the Meldebestätigung, but then the app didn’t allow me to upload anything useful.For days I’ve been stuck in support chats where every agent gives a different answer, keeps repeating the same things, and no one actually solves the issue. I sent everything they asked for — passport, ID, even registration documents — and still no progress.I lost time, energy, and nearly my salary trying to use Wise in Germany. It’s a shame, because the idea is great, but the execution and customer support are unbelievably bad.I do NOT recommend Wise if you’re a student, traveler, or someone needing fast access to your money abroad.\n",
      "54. I already had my account connected for years.They disconnected it somehow and I am required to verify my identity???\n",
      "55. Wise used to be good, but customer service rapidly went south.Tried to make a fee-free £3,000 card transfer today - not for the first time - which was declined. The reason given was \"this payment wasn't within our risk appetite.\"Forced into sending a SWIFT payment which comes with a £28.49 fee plus associated & unknown correspondent bank fees.Are you or are you not an Electronic Money Institution, Wise?Have a been treated fairly as a customer?EDIT REPLY: Wise, there's a big difference between believing your customers deserve the best, and providing the best. As the support was woefully poor, a complaint was lodged last week. I would have thought you would've been more diligent when checking your records.\n",
      "56. It’s a good alternative, but their rate are high!\n",
      "57. Have used Wise for travelling for a couple of years. Have been really satisfied. Until this trip. Landed in Switzerland on Saturday. Went into my Wise account and transferred funds from my Canadian bank account to my Wise card. Got a notice that it could take until Thursday to get the funds loaded. I thought oh that must be worst case scenario - it’s always been instant in the past. But here it is Tuesday and still no sign of the funds. I checked my bank account - funds were transferred on Monday. So pray tell - why should it take yet another 3 days for the funds to arrive to my card from the day they left my bank account. It’s 2025. I’m shocked and so disappointed.\n",
      "58. I wrote a review about my frustration with the security selfies. Wise answered my review and I followed both links. One took  me to wise security for documents downloading. It only asked for a photo ID  and I downloaded my passport, and wasn't asked for anything else. So far I didn't have any luck to do a transfer, because they still ask for a selfie. The \"help link\" asks for payment for help!! That is similar to blackmail.. !\n",
      "59. Wise Business is absolute hopeless, verification check is slow and painful, can't transfer money into wise unless comes exactly from the exact same name, customer support is awful. I'm sprinting over to Business revolut and be more than happy to pay $10 a month to avoid Wise.\n",
      "60. Wise suddenly closed my account without any prior warning or proper explanation.They returned the funds, but with no detailed statement of the transfer fees applied. I requested a full breakdown to check if any money had been deducted, but never received a clear answer.I feel robbed and treated with complete lack of respect as a customer. This kind of practice is unacceptable, especially in the UK. You can’t just shut down accounts and hide behind automated messages. Very disappointing.(After reading their reply ...)Thank you for your reply, although I find it extremely vague and disappointing.You mention “reasonable security measures” and “sufficient reason” without specifying anything. I believe that closing a personal account with no prior warning, no explanation, and no specific allegations is neither reasonable nor respectful towards your customers.If there was a genuine issue, I have the right to be informed. Otherwise, this feels more like a random and unjustified closure, and it raises serious concerns about how Wise treats its users and their funds.Also, asking me to go through multiple pages and vague links just to get a refund receipt shows a lack of transparency and poor customer care.I would appreciate a clear and specific explanation of why my account was closed, and I believe others should know how you operate.\n",
      "61. I thought wise was amazing until something went terribly wrong. I saved for months for my holiday, carefully putting money into my account when the exchange rate was good. However, when I purchased flights overseas in my local currency (AUD) I accidentally entered my local credit card CSV and expiry date but my Wise credit card number. I would have thought that because the details were incorrect this transaction would be rejected. On other occassions, even when the details are correct I am prompted to approve it on the Wise website. However, the transaction went through immediately and because I didnt have and AUD in my account Wise took it upon themselves to exchange all my currencies back to AUD. Of course, Wise made money on this transaction. Although I called Wise immediately I was told there was nothing they could do. Luckily, the airline was more helpful and refunded the money. However, it returned to my account 2 days later and the exchange rate had dropped plus Wise wanted to charge me n admin fee again for changing my money back to the way it was prior to them approving the transaction. Worse part is that despite my numerous emails and chats nobody has responded to why this occurred and what can be done. I am now hundreds of dollars out of pocket. The product when it works is amazing and a simple call or email could have solved my issues and resulted in me not writing this review. Customer service is as important as having a good product.\n",
      "62. Your holding up my funds from my own accounts that have been accepted as transfers regularly\n",
      "63. Biggest Scam Ever! take care!The positive Feedback is created with AI. They Scam the People and sells all the Data and Informations,  they can get! And they tell storys about regulation. Its just a Scam! They take 250 Euro and tells me they will not give it back! Save your Money and your Time. F...CK THIS SCAMMERS\n",
      "64. Debit card didn't work, USD EURO rate was awful. For $ 1,000 total fees were over $60 and still didn't take the card. Horrible service.\n",
      "65. I can't use my creditcard, and I do not get a good answer on my question why.\n",
      "66. Every time i need to enter the app, I'm always asked for email and psw. No face reading. Very slow process.\n",
      "67. I was unable to log in to Wise, so I contacted customer service at the designated phone number. The number was a Belgian number, so it was free from Germany. However, without confirming that it was an international call, I was connected to Japan and later had to pay 9.5 euros in international call charges from my phone company.Customer service should have notified me in advance that it was an international call. They should refund the 9.5 euros.Furthermore, the customer service representative in question did not respond sincerely to my request but merely repeated a standard script.\n",
      "68. We want Confirm all the people with none sense experience with Wise.They also not recruiting clear English people there.   None sense for your money.They also think they can do whatever they want with your account.They never send any follow up email.They also change rules without to tell.Not good at all..\n",
      "69. Thank you for responding. However, your reply does not address my main concern: my account was closed without any clear or specific reason, despite my full verification and compliance.I have already followed the appeal process, explained the VPN issue (which was purely accidental and promptly clarified), yet received no reconsideration or transparency. I was not even given a chance to resolve the situation before a permanent decision was made.As a verified small business owner, this abrupt closure has severely impacted my operations, and the lack of human review in such cases is alarming. I urge Wise to not hide behind general policy links, please treat your loyal customers fairly, especially when they reach out in good faith.I respectfully request:A detailed explanation of the exact reason for closure.A genuine re-evaluation of my case.Automation should never replace empathy and fairness.#WiseSupport #AccountClosedUnfairly #ReopenMyAccount #SmallBusinessMatters\n",
      "70. I spent over 40 minutes on a landline call with a Wise support representative named Yeghin, who, rather than assisting me, gave misleading information in an apparent attempt to end the call prematurely.The issue was simple but urgent: my wife, who is currently living in Vietnam, needed to transfer funds to me. She attempted to create and verify a Wise account but couldn’t get past the phone number verification stage. Regardless of whether she selected SMS, WhatsApp, or Voice Call, she kept getting the same error: “We are unable to send an SMS to your number.” Since calling the US or UK support numbers would have been prohibitively expensive, her only option was to email support, which she did. She received a case number and an automated response stating it could take 24 hours or more for a reply which was completely unacceptable given the urgency.I called Wise on her behalf using my own account, offered to verify both my identity and hers, and provided to the representative all necessary details to help resolve the login issue. Despite this, the representative ignored what I was saying and claimed that if my wife simply emailed again, she would receive a response “within minutes.” When I asked if she could stay on the line to ensure that happened, she refused, saying it might take up to an hour or more. Upon further questioning, she finally admitted that the wait time could, in fact, still be 24 hours or longer.Throughout the call, I passed all security checks for my own account, and I was prepared to share all of my wife’s credentials and security details. I even connected my mobile to my wife's mobile via speakerphone so the operator could speak with her directly. Still, no assistance was provided, even though the issue was simply a login problem—not a transaction or security risk—and my wife’s identity could have been easily verified.This experience was incredibly frustrating, especially given the urgency of the situation and our willingness to cooperate fully.It’s only when you have a genuine emergency and really need help that you discover how good a company truly is. I have used Wise to transfer hundreds of thousands of pounds over the past year. That ends now. I’ll be taking my business to one of the many other companies that offer a better service. I will never use Wise again.**EDIT – After reaching out to Wise three more times and spending a total of 75 minutes on the telephone I received no meaningful help. I eventually discovered - through a Reddit post, not Wise themselves - that it's not possible to create a Wise account or send money from Vietnam.At no point was this ever communicated to me or my wife by Wise support, despite multiple attempts to get assistance. It's incredibly concerning that even senior support staff seem unaware of such a fundamental limitation of their own service.When Wise works, it works well. But when something goes wrong, you're left completely in the dark, with incompetent support and zero transparency. For a company handling people's money, that's simply unacceptable. Wise fell woefully short of even the most basic standards of customer service in our case.**\n",
      "71. I ordered my Wise card on 22 June 2025, and according to them, it was “delivered” - yet I never received it and got no delivery confirmation whatsoever.To make matters worse, Wise has not responded to my support request, and now they’re asking me to pay another €4 to get a replacement card. Why should I be charged for something completely out of my control?Extremely disappointing experience for a company that claims to be customer-focused. I expected better accountability and communication. This feels like I’m being penalized for their delivery failure.\n",
      "72. it was good, thank you\n",
      "73. Wise is a scam! ATTENTION!Please think twice before opening an account. I have set up an account with them and put some money on the balance, then , after some time made a transfer to my Revolut. Soon they just closed my account and now i do not know where is my money and what happens then.For whatever the reason, after i have submitted the appeal, i keep on getting the same email from Wise to repeat the process all over again. Not the whole one but the *reason for the transfer* part of it.First of all, i am getting sick and tired of this. Second of all, i do not understand why transferring money from my own account to my other account should cause any issues???I have moved EURO 3000 to my Revolut without any issue, which is exactly what i have expected. Then after making another transfer i have started having issue. Why? It took me a while to make it happen. I thought that this is it but after making another transfer i have been asked for even more things and my account got blocked. Why? This is all so stupid.NOW I HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THEM, SAYING THAT I WILL NOT GET MY REFUND!!!\n",
      "74. I submitted an appeal 20 days ago after Wise closed my account. I provided the required bank statement – but no one contacted me to say it was wrong. Only when I reached out myself did I finally hear back.A support agent admitted in a call that Wise made a mistake – they failed to explain that the bank statement had to come from an external source, not their own app. She later sent an email confirming it was Wise’s error and asked me to submit a new appeal, assuring me it would be handled faster.But why should I wait another 20 days (or more) because of their mistake?During all this time, I’ve repeatedly explained that I urgently need access to my funds – I’m literally living on borrowed money. It’s completely unreasonable to expect people to survive without access to their own finances, especially over weekends and holidays when money is needed the most.I understand the need for compliance checks if there’s a suspicion – that’s normal. But everything already took 20 days. Starting again from zero is unfair, unacceptable, and inhumane.Wise, this is not just poor service – it’s a real hardship caused by your internal miscommunication. Please fix this and release my funds immediately.Dear Wise Appeals TeamI am writing to formally request a re-evaluation of my appeal regarding the frozen funds in my account.I have submitted all the requested documents, including the additional bank statement from a different financial institution (outside of Wise), as instructed during my last communication with your support team.More than 20 days have passed since my most recent appeal submission, and I have still not received any updates regarding the status of my case. When I contacted your support team after the initial 20-day delay, I was told that no one had followed up because the additional bank statement had not been provided — even though this requirement was never previously communicated to me. I was then instructed to resubmit my appeal with the new document and wait another 20 days.This situation has now been ongoing for over 60 days, which I believe is unacceptable. I am facing serious financial hardship, and I want to emphasize that I genuinely need access to these funds. I have fully complied with all your requirements and submitted everything asked of me. Therefore, I believe that withholding my money under these circumstances may be unlawful and should be reviewed immediately.I kindly ask you to treat this matter with the urgency it requires and provide a clear update on the current status of my appeal, along with a timeline for resolution.\n",
      "75. Called customer support from Zambia about a failed transaction and the operator I spoke to misunderstood my issue and instead of clarifying it with me, she irreversibly cancelled my card. I am currently in Zambia with no access to cash whatsoever and the customer service is nothing short of appalling. Wish I had stuck to my trusty post office card!!!!\n",
      "76. Generic answer message not fitted to the situation.\n",
      "77. I like the whole concept of wise and have recommended it several times.I real downfall of wise is the user unfriendly website.For example - how do I create a new jar. All instruction to create a new jar do not work on my wise home page.\n",
      "78. blocked accounts without cause and then while banning and horrible customer care. i barely made one transfer a year\n",
      "79. Deposit from interest account to normal account was cancelled!!!\n",
      "80. You are a bunch of crooks\n",
      "81. There is always some new thing we have to do to verify the identity of ourselves or the person we are paying. they rely on the income and Wise is constantly pausing payments and hassling us for more information, despite payments being made to this person for YEARS. Not impressed at all.\n",
      "82. Wise drives me up the wall with inconsistency. Three times in a row, my transfer will take seconds to arrive in my account. Then for one or transfers it take four days. There is no reason for it.\n",
      "83. There was a transaction, from someone what I haven't authorised. Not a big amount but still my money. Wise was unable to solve that issue.So, I wouldn't recommend them. I only put a tiny amount of money on my account, and using the card paying motorway tolls. But nothing serious.\n",
      "84. Easy to set up an account but you cannot link the TSB bank to the account. This  severely restricts how you can use the account and is very surprising when the TSB is one of the UKs major banking groups.\n",
      "85. Good but it can be done much better and the charges was very high\n",
      "86. After returning to UK upon retirement, I opened a Wise account with the intention of consolidating my savings.However, Wise promptly closed the account and are “unable” to give a reason for this.I’m not sure how much money I have in the account or whether they will be able to refund it.\n",
      "87. Quite possibly the WORST bank to exist. There isn’t a time where I haven’t had issues. Transfers taking days on end, top ups not arriving, always chasing down my money from wise. The worst part? They take 0 accountability and will put the blame on you or other banks. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC.\n",
      "88. I was trying to transfer my money from my another bank to Wise for an important payment. But it took about 7 hours! The amount disappeared from my account in the bank and didn't appeared at the Wise account. The situation was very difficult for me. I had to use another service. And this amount was blocked, so I needed additional money. So - you are extremely slow! This is even dangerous.\n",
      "89. Account hot hacked and after that wise blocked all my cards. None worked online. They offered no solution other than go to an atm which doesn't work if you're housebound. Then they offered no solutions. Rubbish\n",
      "90. Been working for a company editing media for them for years with being paid through wise with no problems and recently they decided to block my pay from them for no reason. I understand they may have to do some checks but the payment was not delivered for over a week and my employer couldn’t cancel the transaction either and it was not resolved for over a week. If these checks are necessary they should be sorted swiftly.\n",
      "91. We could not complete the transaction. We used to have no issues in the past, but now for some reason one of the accounts remains deactivated no matter what we try.\n",
      "92. Impossible to use the app, it says I have an existing account while I never created any.Tried to open a new account with a new email address, same error message.Anyway, the customer service is deplorable AND when I ask to call me back because I am in another country and paid already a lot of money for 10 minutes of arguing, the customer agent was like \"I am going to put you on hold, please call us back\"What the heck!?I am calling for an emergency and they were not capable of helping, just saying call us back.I can hardly imagine if this can get any better..\n",
      "93. Bad experience! No return! No justification for the delay!\n",
      "94. They make it very difficult to send money, and while I appreciate them wanting to make sure everything is on the up and up, more often than not, they are making it very hard to send money for legitimate reasons.  For example, recently I tried to send money, and they cancelled the transfer.  I tried again, and it was cancelled again.  I contacted support who said that I had not provided additional information they had requested.  I said I had received no such request - after looking into it, they admitted that they had not sent any email to me nor called me nor contacted me in any way.  Then they said to give them time to figure it out.  We have made some progress, but I still have not gotten the money sent, and it is time sensitive.\n",
      "95. I ask to switch from personal to business one guy say no problem waiting 30 minutes on the phone and the lady say not possible\n",
      "96. The transfer is locked for 7 days with no possibility to cancel it.\n",
      "97. When a bank decides what a customer can buy or not, you’re not doing well !!!!I want to diversify and buy crypto and wise does not permit this !!! Shame on you !! Instead of evolving with the future you’re holding people back !!! The USA is have its national reserves invested in crypto but wise will not allow people to buy ! Where is the logic\n",
      "98. I received an email on July 1, from Wise.com that a vendor had wired me €140,000 ($162,000 USD) and that my bank, UBS should credit me within two to three business days, but no money arrived.  Wise kept making excuses.  The account information was all correct.  We asked for a wire trace and told the wire went out.  Yet no funds.In the second week, Wise asked UBS to issue a wire rejection letter, which they could not do bc no wire was received.  More excuses from Wise‘s underpaid, understaffed group of employees.  No responsibility whatsoever.At the end of the third week, the 18th of July, Wise sent a request to return payment of the wire at 8AM, and at 10AM payment was received!  UBS refused the request, bc they knew the situation, but Wise was literally trying to prolong the process.Highly unprofessional organization ruining counterpart companies.  DO NOT USE!   These people are idiots.\n",
      "99. While the Wise card top-ups are really simple and very quick, transferring a large sum is not so simple. First I went through the process at 16:00 (ish) last Friday because I needed the funds to buy a house. I received a message which clearly states: \"Your money's on its way to us. Your bank might take up to 3 days to get it to us. We'll let you know when it's arrived. Monday, 14 July at 10:18 we receive your GBP. Monday at 10:18 we pay out your GBP.\". That was a lie. I checked my accounts, even tried again with another \"sure\" date and time. Finally, I had to do an international transfer through my bank, losing me a lot of money. It was that, or lose the house!Ill still use the top-up card but never again will I trust Wise with a life-changing sum of money.\n",
      "100. Wise is very bad. I used its function to block reccuring payment and it didnt block the payment. They steal from me\n",
      "101. One of the worst bank for new businesses customer service not helpful at all charges £45 to open account but had to close it down because of bad customer service but they refused to pay my £45 back will not recommend to anyone to go with this bank\n",
      "102. I've transfered 1,500EUR to my wise account and apparently they cannot locate the payment. Be careful, you're money is not always safe with them. I've provided proof that the bank details I've used are correct and yet nobody feels responsible and is willing to refund. I've now contacted my bank to see what options I have. Regardless, this is the second time I've got issues with wise within 12 month which means I can no longer trust in their services. If possible, avoid or use another provider before this happens to you too.\n",
      "103. Too expensive\n",
      "104. my daughter's account was bocked more t'han 1 year ago because she was not 18 yet....after claiming severals times to be unblocked, because since March she's 18, she have not any answer from Wise. Wise has her Money and they don't give It her back ...someone can help me, please?!\n",
      "105. Before it was very easy to use but now it’s very worst to use this one\n",
      "106. I sent a transfer from a Turkish bank to my Wise account on July 8. My bank confirmed that the funds were successfully delivered to the receiving side on July 9. I have provided Wise with all the necessary documents:SWIFT MT103A screenshot confirming deliveryFull transfer detailsHowever, as of today (July 18), the funds have still not been credited. I contacted Wise support several times in advance to check the status, but each time I was told to wait. Only after 10 days did the investigation begin. Now I’m being asked to wait a few more days again.I truly respect the support team and understand that technical or banking delays can happen. However, quite a bit of time has passed and the situation remains unclear. I sincerely hope this issue will be resolved soon and I won’t need to escalate further.I kindly ask the Wise team to provide a clearer update and to help expedite the process.If the issue is resolved promptly, I will be happy to update this review accordingly.\n",
      "107. I never had a complaint until recently.  The website did not recognize my password, I got frozen out of my account in the middle of a large transfer causing panic.  It is impossible to reach them except by email, and the answers are rote, copying the website on how to re-set password, which was not working.  I finally googled possible solutions and one was to change browser, this worked!  Wise now recognized my password and let me in to complete transfer…You cannot chat or call, which can really leave you alone with a financial problem in a foreign country where you absolutely need a trustworthy financial website.  Wise can mostly be this except for when it’s not….\n",
      "108. Very poor „Help“ functions. Unable to contact anyone to find out if inward payment has been received as it is not shown in the Account.\n",
      "109. Easy to fill out forms.Occasionally, and without reason, delay delivery of my funds for several days. Sometimes it’s almost instantaneous.This can create issues and only encourages me to use an additional company.Reply to Wise:When we are talking about Dollars and Euros, there seems to be little reason for delay. There’s no bank holiday in either country this week. (This is what I mean when I say, “without reason.”\n",
      "110. Tech support response was quick and accurate, but I was disappointed that to connect my bank account I would have to use Plaid. I and many others will never give our bank usernames and passwords to anyone for any reason. This strategy sucks for so many good reasons.I didn’t have to use Plaid for my personal Wise account, but it’s a no-go for my business purposes.Update: I read your reply and found it disingenuous. Your tech support team has already confirmed that there isn’t any other way of connecting my bank account other than using Plaid, which I believe comprises my username and password. I would be interested in a way of connecting my bank account that doesn’t compromise my security, but you don’t offer one.\n",
      "111. I’ve been using Wise since 2014, and up until recently, I found their service exceptional—efficient and reliable. However, things have changed. They’ve started refusing to send routine payments they’ve handled for me for years, including my monthly Barclaycard payment and an annual subscription to a market data provider. When I asked why, I received vague responses like “we can’t give any extra information due to regulations” and “this transaction is outside our risk appetite.” It’s frustrating and disappointing to see a service I trusted become so unhelpful and opaque.18 July 2025: Addendum added in response to Wise's reply:The success of fintechs like Wise lies in their supposed efficiency, transparency, and agility compared to traditional banks. Yet the service I’ve encountered recently reflects the opposite. In fact, Wise now comes a poor second even to high-street banks, which would at least have transmitted my Barclaycard payment and my annual TradingView subscription without issue.Refusing to send clients’ money for perfectly legal and proper purposes is not just inconvenient — it’s offensive. Are Wise trying to destroy their own business? I’ve already opened an account with another provider and will be moving my business there.Finally, while I note Wise’s offer to “double-check” the payments, I had already raised these issues and received a response to each. It’s unclear what purpose another check would serve beyond repetition.\n",
      "112. This is gay bank whatever u send them its not good enough. This bank should not exist. They try to be important but only they are bullshit bank. Regular shit “bank”. And always be.\n",
      "113. If there is an option -100 stars i will give to this wise.com app. They are a scammers they have taken my money and now they are not taking my calls no answered bullshit service. They are not giving my money back. So guys please be aware from wise.com they are a big scammers\n",
      "114. When wise works as expected it works fine. I usually transfer money from my USA account to my wise account. Often it take minutes other time it take 4-7 days. The anxiety associated with that is undesirable as I travel to other countries and sometimes i need the money now !  I pay rent and for example in Brazil they only want to be paid by “Pix” so I rely on a friend for making the payement and I reimburse her.  Anyway the web site or the App does not operate consistently and intuitively.  I am sometimes given a choice prior to submit to add money via a debit or credit and other methods with different rates to get it in minutes or hours. That choice the last time was not available. The person on the phone walked me through and she witness this discrepancy. I then tried on my tablet then on a PC accessing my account via a web instead of the app and still that reference page was gone.  The only choice I was left with was 4 Bussiness days. My rent was late. But the Air&B landlord was understanding .   I suppose depending on the day this is a love and hate relationships. I literally have to calculate my strategy every time in fear of the system to not cooperate.   Also now in my transaction history i cant see my all my information such as canceling my transfer information which i used to discuss with the support center. They see it but i dont and i used to. Perhaps a tab just for those should be available.\n",
      "115. Attempted to put money into my Wise account , using the Pay ID option two weeks ago , still hasn’t reached my account . Not great seeing I am travelling .Filled out all the required documents and forwarded as per instructions.\n",
      "116. Dear Wise Team,I hope this message finds you well.I am writing to raise a concern regarding a discrepancy of approximately £1000 in my account. I understand that around £150 may have been used for currency conversion when converting £20,000 from GBP to EUR and then back again. However, there still appears to be a shortfall of about £1000.I have reviewed my bank statement and can provide documentation showing that the amount received is £1000 less than what I initially transferred to my Wise account.Could you please investigate this matter and help clarify the missing amount?Thank you in advance for your assistance.John Hollins\n",
      "117. Yall blocked my account without even explaining to me why. That was so shady and i would never save my money with you.\n",
      "118. It's a great online bank easy to use and easy to transfer money between banks however there will be a charge also you should have free withdrawals from your home country ATMs no limit to how many I travel in Europe a lot and more and more restaurants and bars are getting rid of their card readers and going cash only especially in southern Spain I find this a problem not being able to withdraw cash on a daily basis without incurrent fees\n",
      "119. There were too many different people answering me on the same issue and they didn't seem to have read what the previous persons had written.\n",
      "120. Wise used to be a good company - automating processes, saving money for the consumers, responding to customer inquiries with genuine concern, etc.  No longer is that the case, because of one simple fact: they no longer know how to deal with customers and provide service.Recently, I wanted to add a second US ACH Bank account to my profile, but there is no way to do it.  This is a Vanguard CashPlus account (administered by PNC but can't log in through PNC).  So I sent an email asking how to do it since instant verification through Plaid will fail.  And instead of fixing their systems, they just put me on the merry-go-round of approximately 10 emails.  Even after sending them many screenshots showing there is NO option they refer to, they insist on my having to call them.  I asked them to send me the screenshots showing where the option they refer to is, and their response: We don't send screenshots.  We are WISE.  I felt like they must have \"Wise über alles\" as their company anthem and song.Anyway, the way forward is simple: reduce the dependence on Wise and eliminate it as time goes by.  Good luck Wise and good tidings.UPDATE after First WISE Reply: Wise is very WISE and accordingly, they have deployed WiseAI to provide Cookie Cutter responses to reviews.  The reply is useless, non-contextual, and does not address the unique issue I have.  What a Waste.\n",
      "121. Terrible bad company. This should not exist. UK  company should understand that world is no longer colony but a competitive market.I downloaded app and attempted to Register to set up my account on wise. After typing email, it said NEXT but then reply came \"TOO MANY times, try later again\". Ten times same reply.Then I called customer service. Poor voice. Extremely poor English, poor accent. He could nottype Email after 5 minutes struggle. Asked for Supervisor, phone waiting 20 minutes, no one showed up.Called 2nd time customer service, he want to go toanother computer and open different browser. idiot.Called 3rd time another customer person, she for 10 minutes could not understand how to help to register.WISE shame on you.Check rates for Pakistan. WORST rates plus 6.95 dollar fee. Rate plus fee, I loose 20 dollars.Close company. Chairman and company directors are not worth to be a clerk with such a bad app,bad rates. This happened on July 16, 2025\n",
      "122. I recently completed an international transfer from the USA to Norway. When I initiated the transfer, I was shown a guaranteed exchange rate, which I fully understand was only valid if the funds were received by Wise within 8 hours. However it took 4 days for Wise to receive the funds, so the guaranteed rate had expired, and the mid-market rate at the time of conversion should have been applied instead.By the time the conversion occurred, the USD had strengthened significantly. Based on that, I was expecting to receive more in NOK than originally quoted — just as I would have expected to receive less had the USD weakened during that same period.This is not what happened,  my frustration, it appears that Wise reverted back to the expired guaranteed rate rather than applying the mid-market rate as stated in the agreement. This resulted in a difference of around $400, which I feel is being unfairly pocketed by Wise.I’ve contacted customer service, but so far the responses have been unhelpful and generic. What’s even more frustrating is receiving emails from Wise customer service that don’t allow replies, making it difficult to have a productive conversation.Ref. Wise's Response:According to Wise’s own stated policy explained in Wise's answer, the mid-market rate at the time of conversion should have been used. However, Wise instead applied a guaranteed rate that had expired four days before the funds were even received.By relying on this outdated rate — contrary to the policy they outlined — Wise effectively shorted the conversion. Had the correct rate been used, I would have received approximately $400 more than I did since the exchange rates was much more favorable at the time that they received the funds . Instead, I feel that Wise benefited from the difference, at my expense.This is both disappointing and unethical.\n",
      "123. Only if I could give negative. This app never worked for me.\n",
      "124. **Reply to WISE comment: Your staff don't understand banking processes because you are simply a call centre with no banking knowledge. The only action you staff took for SIX WEEKS is refuse to offer support and refuse to investigate and threaten me. That's fine if you refer me to technical staff but Wise refuse and ignore their own T&Cs. In fact the only advice Wise gave was - we don't need to help you - GO TALK TO THE OTHER BANK ON YOUR OWN!!**The customer service is a disasterThey have no knowledge of banking operational processes. This causes two serious issues. 1) Unless very basic, they don't know how to answer questions eg why an ATM debit at BPI appeared as Security bank at a completely different location (twice) on the bank statement thus causing a false 250php fee in error. 2) Worse still, they lie or say anything to close the case because they don't understand the problem, refuse to speak to BPI and refuse to refer it to their technical teams and say speaking to managers is impossible. My case was closed 4 times and they refuse to refund illegal charges.\n",
      "125. It would have been an easy 5 stars from me right until they decided to close my account for no apparent reason, or if there was one they are not willing to share it. I switched from Payoneer to Wise because friends told me it was a better way to get paid, and for a long time I used their excellent service without much hassle. I was getting paid globally easily and also paying for anything or anyone without issues. I don't know if it was because of my country of residence but a while back, Wise removed my USD receiving account info so I had to switch to EUR for all my payments (that added some conversion fees, but it was better than nothing and I was used to Wise at this point so didn't make sense to make the switch to another platform.) I was able to use my virtual Wise card without any issues on a lot of platforms, in different countries when I was traveling and so on. The experience was great. But then... last week, without any prior notice, my account was closed. I was given absolutely no reason for why this was happening. I guess that's just how they work: they can close your account with out any notice and they are not required to provide a reason as well. This doesn't make sense at all. Anyways there was the option to make an appeal and I did so but it was rejected. The worst part is since Wise was my primary bank account, all my funds were primarily on it. Now I have no way of accessing it and support just says the money is being refunded and that's that. Really disappointed in how things ended but it was a great service while they were willing to provide it for me. I'm sure a lot of people will make a great use out of it. But it might not be the best option for people from Ethiopia (I think they no longer support Ethiopia even, which is sad.) Payoneer and Dukascopy are better alternatives if you are from Ethiopia or a country they are no longer willing to support.\n",
      "126. After trying 4 times, 2 times gave my indian address, two times gave my London address, still havent received my physical card. Everytime when i had to reapply for the so called card that is missed somewhere four times in cargo, I had to change the card number to all my business transaction places like googleads, meta, my international number, shopify, for my vendors etc etc etc. So, finally i accepted my defeat and living with the virtual card and card number i have. Gave review , spoke to customer service but… no results. I really appreciate wise other services but this card issue has made me give it one star. Rest wise is good.\n",
      "127. I really liked this company as long as everything went smoothly. But when I needed to rely on customer service, no reasonable conversation was possible, no argument was listened to. What happened was that I requested a transfer from my Wise account to my UK account. In the personal memo section, I mentioned the first name of my niece, a student in the UK, just as a reminder to myself that some of the money should be earmarked for her. Wise reacted by requesting the full name and the National ID # of my niece. I gave them the full name and a website that listed her as a PhD student of a London University. I also directly informed the receiving bank who the person mentioned in the memo line was – she is in their system from other transfers. My UK bank  credited the transfer, they were satisfied with the information I provided. They seem to have understood that I could not responsibly transmit highly sensitive information (corresponding to a Social Security Number in the US) via a simple e-mail, in particular since that information was not about the recipient of the transfer, but merely about a person mentioned in the personal memo line. Wise however reacted by proceeding to close my account since I did not give them the requested information. They claimed I violated their user agreement, but never specified the nature of the violation – they never  mentioned the relevant clause in the agreement. When I filed a complaint, they simply sent the user agreement, again without specifying why they think any of its clauses was violated. They are now going to close my account. They never responded to my argument that the information they requested was not information that I was entitled to paste into an e-mail. They also never acknowledged that I did provide information to both them and the receiving bank that allowed them to uniquely identify my niece without security risks and in a way that would normally eliminate any suspicion about improper uses. If Wise had normal customer service that allowed you to actually interact with a particular person, this kind of problem would have never arisen - the problem would have disappeared after a single conversation. In my case, every e-mail I got was signed by a different person (first name only, no phone number, no way to reach the same person again). Given the nature of the responses (making the same point over and over), I wasn't even sure that I was connected to an actual person.The reply from Wise again did not address my specific concern, confirming my impression that they either select from canned responses or employ some mediocre AI.\n",
      "128. Very fast and competitive rates and fees but all let down by their customer service as I had a very bad experience dealing with them for the first time in years being with Wise. Quite rude and cocky and will even threaten you to have your account suspended.\n",
      "129. Was great till it started to charge ATM withdrawals. It's also a higher rate than competitors. It's quite high when overseas.\n",
      "130. Terrible customer service, said I cancelled a deposit when I was not even in the app took 3 days to get my money back, customer service refused to let me speak to anyone above there call centre, tried to get some help through the chat service that was even worse..just kept insisting that it was me that cancelled the deposit no help at all, said someone would call me back, never happened just an email from them. If their fees weren't so good I would find another provider for my travel card. They need to lift their game when it comes to customer service..very disappointed.\n",
      "131. What’s the deal with not being able to transfer from bank for 24hrs?? Need to transfer now, not bloody tomorrow.\n",
      "132. Years ago the money was tranferred in a matter of hours. Now it takes a day.And also navigating your sight gets confusing.Keep it simple.\n",
      "133. Pausing card payments from customers. Asking me to reviewTakes time and restricts my cash flow and you take a percentage of this for delayed payments not happy with that outcome.\n",
      "134. Was putting USD into my account, ready for T/F to another account.My deposit did not appear in my account summary, so I did the deposit again. Then I discovered that the deposit showed up in a different place. Why? The actual transfer of USD went seamlessly.\n",
      "135. I never leave online reviews, but I am so frustrated with this platform that I am here to do just that. There are a lot of specific things you cannot do. Asks for a LOT of verification, some of the payment features either don't work or are very hard to find.You cannot send for example CAD funds to a country other than Canada without exchanging to that country's local currency. You get hit with a lot of fees on payments & transfers into the platform. I write this review while waiting for a SMS authentication method that is not working to make the final payment of our funds out onto another platform.\n",
      "136. I used Wise for a few months and loved the app. BUT, 3 weeks ago my money went missing. It was a complete nightmare dealing with them. Their original contact form is AI generated and does not do anything other than say they have not found your money. When I finally talked to a human they said my proof of payment lacked critical information, when I finally got a mail from them about what they needed, nothing was missing. Finally after 2 weeks the money was returned to my original bank account, So I tried again. Same thing. Money is gone. My bank can prove Barclays received the money. Wise refuses to contact Barclays about the funds and continues to stonewall with stupid excuses. They are a bunch of amateurs.\n",
      "137. Got my transfer cancelled after all the verification documents were accepted. One employee told me my money was on the way to get credited on my account and another one told me my documents weren’t accepted when I clearly got the confirmation email that all was good. They aren’t even coordinated someone isn’t doing his job right. I’m just going to somewhere else\n",
      "138. Very late delevery this time. 2-3 days..\n",
      "139. It takes way too long to receive a transfer. Moving forward, we are avoiding  \"Wise\" and using other, faster channels, for business and personal purposes. The \"receive funds\" process is so invasive, it gives my gynecologist a run for her money. The kicker? I tried to add  just one of our international accounts and it would not take - over and over. I'm still waiting on a transfer from last week. From one US account to another. Everyone else has been redirected to other, lesser time-consuming, non-invasive. lesser expensive  methods for transfers.\"Wise\" is not wise.\n",
      "140. My card used to work perfect untill the last update, now I cant transfer funds from my UK account as it comes up with an error code. therefore phone app is useless as now have to use desktop\n",
      "141. Blocked my account after 5 years of use and nobody is willing to help\n",
      "142. Have had the most terrible experience here on wise. I’ve reached out to their customer service team daily on every platform and no one is giving a single care about the situation. 2 weeks they’ve held thousands of my money frozen. They informed me to provide them information I did exactly that they said it would take 2 business days to get fixed. It’s been 2 weeks!! I call, email, text every day and get brushed off every single time!! I’m starting to think this is a scam. I have a terminally ill father who is in chemo and they’re restricting me from my hard earned money!! They have showed 0 care or humility on the situation. I’m already stressed out of my mind with my situation and I feel like they’ve taken me for a total ride. The most horrible experience I’ve ever had in my life. PLEASE CAN SOMEONE JUST TAKE 5 mins out of their time to look at the ticket and fix it!!! I’m on the verge of a mental break down at this point JUST HELP ME!!!\n",
      "143. I have never experienced such poor customer service.I sent money to my Thai bank account via Wise, and the transfer simply never arrived. It’s now been 3 days, and I still have no access to the funds.I was initially told — by what felt like an AI response — that it was a “known issue” with their partner and it would be resolved within a day. It wasn’t.I then received conflicting information: one agent blamed my bank (it wasn’t my bank), and another claimed they’d retry the transfer — but instead, they canceled it without my consent.I explained that I urgently needed this money to pay for housing and basic living costs, and yet I received no meaningful response or action. No one took ownership. No one escalated my case properly. I was denied access to a manager.The end result? I lost the condo I was supposed to move into, and I’ve been left with no funds to live because of Wise’s handling of this situation.A company holding customer funds like this, providing zero real support, and refusing escalation during a crisis should not be in the business of money transfers.Avoid Wise — especially if you're relying on them for urgent transfers. They left me stranded.\n",
      "144. In the past 3 days, 3 or 4 of my transfers have been cancelled.I’m currently on holiday, and my vacation has been completely ruined.I worked all year and saved up money just for this trip. I trusted Wise and didn’t bring cash with me — now I can’t do anything.Thank you, Wise, for destroying all my holiday plans and dreams.\n",

      "6. It's the worst customer care service I ever experienced. They don't care anything. They hang up on you,  they are rude, they are not answering your questions and totally not helpful . I lost 300 us dollar and they were laughing at me instead of helping\n",
      "7. Subject: Formal Complaint – Withholding of Funds and Unprofessional Conduct at M Lhuillier Branch (Barangka Drive, Mandaluyong City Philippines)I am writing to formally express my disappointment and frustration regarding the unacceptable treatment my nephew experienced at your M Lhuillier branch on Barangka Drive, Mandaluyong City, involving a recent money transfer I sent.This is the second time I have sent funds to my nephew through your service. On this occasion, all details I provided—including his full name and identification—accurately matched his government-issued licence, as required.However, your staff member, Lianie, not only withheld the funds, but also made my nephew wait for more than two hours, and then unexpectedly demanded a birth certificate without any valid explanation. This requirement was never mentioned as part of your identification policy, and it caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.To make matters worse, when I called the branch to respectfully inquire about the situation, the person I spoke with hung up on me, which I find to be highly disrespectful and unprofessional.This kind of treatment is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the level of service and customer care one should expect from a reputable remittance company. I request that this matter be:1. Investigated and clarified, particularly the reason for the withholding of funds and the request for a birth certificate.2. Addressed internally to ensure that no other customer experiences similar delays and disrespect.3. Met with a formal apology from the branch concerned and a clear explanation of the identification policy that was applied.Please confirm receipt of this complaint and advise on the steps you will take to resolve this issue. I look forward to your prompt and professional response.\n",
      "8. If there is a score of zero i would absolutely put that on world remit. I have been their customer for years but lately june and july  it took them 5 days to process. When my recipient checked at the bank no money was received at their end... opposite to their promise that processing will only start during tuesdays in the philippines... when i called them back the only answer that they gave me was the transaction was cancelled? After 5 days???? 2 successive months the same thing happened to my transactions????  There must be something fishy going on... i found out that world remit is a sister company of send wave... now is send wave reliable? Thats a big question to me now...\n",
      "9. Transfers not going through and still waiting for a refund after 7 days.\n",
      "10. The \"customer care\" are unable to address the issue. The app will not update the phone number. Customer care is unable to update receiver details. Every new agent has a assumption, repetitive denial syndrome, impatient and following prompts it seems  I've deleted the receiver. I've deleted app. Etc. The app will not updated the receiver details. IE glitch/bug. No one I've spoken with has yet to grasp this fact. No I'm not overlooking anything.\n",
      "11. I ve used this service along with western union for as long as I can remember. They used to the best but now worst customer service, non existant. Tried to call but no one on the other end or their are closed. Still waiting for refund after had issue with my last transaction 4 weeks ago. They keep changing processing day every day. Ended up using western Union, which will be my go to place now. Dreadful experience\n",
      "12. Customer service is so bad. Everbody is saying something else. Money took from my bankaccouny by fraude. Reservation worldremit. I am afraid this is not going to be solved and will lose a lot of money. Please don t reply with contact customer service because i will get the same issue\n",
      "13. It has been 23 days now since I performed a transfer using WorldRemit, transfer number 419599932, WorldRemit case number 05972681. Support chats in the WR application is not resolving the issue, the finger still being pointed at the local partner.WorldRemit responded to my earlier review on Trustpilot indicating that I would be contacted, I were contacted but the same information being repeated on the call, waiting for the local partner to reject the transfer.I was then also promised in the call that I will get a daily update on the progress, I appreciated that BUT not unexpectedly I am not being kept updated, empty promises.Still being asked to wait patiently. So Worldremit assuming you are not able to resolve this, it has been 23 days, I do not see how waiting another 23 days is going to resolve this, what is the next steps, what does your manual tell you to do next?\n",
      "14. I have tried to cancel a transaction but the app is not giving me the option. I have submitted the ID they requested, but I want to cancel the transaction as it is now lock, unable to make other transactions. The \"24/7\" is an operator that is not assisting neither, and the phone number are not answering neither. I need assistance ASAP please.\n",
      "15. This app is used by scammers - BewareI received a phone call from someone claiming to be from Debenhams giving me a refund for a top I was trying to return. They got me to download this app and tried to convince me they were issuing a refund through it, but they were actually trying to debit money from my bank account.\n",
      "16. I have been using world remit for three years and made hundreds of transfers.   Everything went smoothly until this July 7th when a transfer of $250 was having \"technical difficulties.\"   They said everything was resolved on July 10th and it was received by my wife from Kenya.   The problem was that it wasn't received and they are making us jump through hoops to prove it.\n",
      "17. I’m extremely disappointed with your service. It’s unacceptable that I cannot reach you through any proper channel — the phone line constantly disconnects, and the chat support is useless and unhelpful. My family has been waiting nearly a week for money that still hasn’t been transferred. This delay is causing serious stress and inconvenience. I expected a much more reliable service\n",
      "18. I am contacting them and both email appears that is wrong. I made a payment of 727 euros for a hotel, they send a message from booking system charging to confirm the booking. After 3 days the hotel said this was a scheme/fraud. Unfortunately I did the payment and the value went to WorldRemit. I tried to enter in contact to say that this was a wrong transaction but I could not reach them by email or phone. So I did a police report. My bank said that how I accepted to do the payment, WorldRemit will not give back my money. But then they are not being complicit in fraud? I hope that they can enter in contact to me to clarify this transaction.THEY ANSWER THAT THEY TOOK THIS SERIOUS AND CONTACT THEM. But my complaint was that I am not able to contact them once the phone and email are incorrect. COULD YOU PLEASE ANSWER HOW CAN I CONTACT YOU? Worldremit?\n",
      "19. Your customer service is useless. No manners and respect to client\n",
      "20. I was abroad seeing to my building projects and had my account closed after cancelling transaction amounting to £4000The transactions were showing as cancelled but money was not returned.I tried numerous times to follow up and this didn’t help.Last time line went dead after asking for information from the account they deactivated for an unknown reasonThey were asking for information which I no longer had access to.When I realised that I had the messages which I had shared they went silent and lime died.I kept sending messages via email but they are no longer responding\n",
      "21. It took more than 24 hours before the transfer showed that it was delivered in Mozambique - at vodacom - At least the person in Mozambique eventually received the money\n",
      "22. On 30 June I sent money on reference 420063747. On 1 July 2025, I received notification that the money had been collected even though I knew that my recipient had not gone to collect the money on that day. He went on 2 July to collect the money and was told that they could not download the transactions. He then presented the collection notice I had received on 1 July. He was asked to contact World Remit for explanation.On 1 July, I contacted online and chatted to Naida and was promised that it would take 2 days to investigate. I contacted again on 4 July and chatted with Alex. I was told they had not received information from local agents. I also phoned on the same day and got the promise that I would get notification email and reference number. I phoned again on 8 July and was promised we would get an email in 3 hours time to confirm the investigation report. I have not received the investigation report or email by the end of the day.On 9 July I phoned again and spoke to Rick and was told the usual line that no response has been received from our agent: Rick promised to escalate the case to his manager.On Friday 11 July I phoned again and was promised that supervisors Kim/Kena will call me between 2-2.15pm UK time but again no phone call came.I am frustrated that this was emergency money and two weeks on I am not any wiser what happened to my transfer. World Remit reputation is at stake here. The investigation and communication process has not been great. I am not sure customer service is a priority for World Remit.23 Days later I still don't know what happened to my money and I still has not spoken to anyone from World Remit.After 24 Days today World Remit sent the following as proof of payment from their agent, which is joke. I wish I could attach it here.\n",
      "23. I got scammed 1st time be careful\n",
      "24. You have very bad customer service. Can’t reach in phone, trying to call from morning keep saying customer services is close and willOpen from 10am-1159pm Monday to Friday. Today is Monday and calling for money transfer. Keep saying that service is closed.  your online chat services is very bad too. As provider you should give good customer service. I am trying to send money from you and it’s very sad to say your services is very very bad.\n",
      "25. Disgusting possible scammers !First 2 or 3 times were bumpy to say the least.This time they have all the excuses under the sun as to the whereabouts of my money.Today is Saturday july 2025 , and still no transfer or refund.PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T USE WORLDREMIT. You will be sorry if you do .\n",
      "26. WorkdRemit app is HORRIBLE do NOT use. I have given them multiple times to improve and they have not. I send the same money to the same people and place and every single time it takes HOURS and the agents hang up in the chat. It’s extremely difficult to get anyone on the phone. The agents don’t provide you with a customer service email when asked. For it to be a money transfer service it’s absolutely horrible and slow bad customer service. Do not use try Sendwave or another but do not use world remit. I think they are scamming people because why would you hold people’s money for days on a supposedly instant transfer of cash? Do not use\n",
      "27. You guys a customer service experience it’s horrible. I’ve been calling and calling and calling every time they hang up on me and now they just repeat the same process and they never call back. This is very stupid.\n",
      "28. Customer service has become worse and worse. I hope to take legal action against the company if by tomorrow evening my recipient has received the money I sent for me. I'll claim a minimum of £5000 to cover mental stress and missed business opportunity could would have yielded £5000 IN 6 months.The transaction number is SLE192021464165. I contacted suport several times yesterday but you refused to answer my calls, and I  also chatted with both your AI assistant and at least two of you human agents, but they still refused to solve my problem. Now my recipient just contacted me that you've paid her the money today but you keep calling her to give you back the money I legally sent for her. If you have any questions, please contact me directly because you have all my contact details. So, I strongly advise you to stop harassing her with immediate effect or I'll have no other option but to take legal action.\n",
      "29. When it works is great, but if you have the slightest issue, it absolutely sucks. Costumer service is awful, not helpful at all, always acting clueless. Been dealing with a pending transaction for over a week and they don’t give solutions, my money is not in my bank account neither where I need it to be and nobody cares. Customer service can’t or won’t do anything about it, neither will transfer to the appropriate department.\n",
      "30. At first, it worked really well and fast. Then they were asking for some documents from me, which I could not upload on their app. They then closed my account. After speaking to customer service, they gave me an email address, saying to send documents there. I did that and never heard back from them. I emailed three more times, asking why nobody is getting back to me anymore. Nothing! So now I cannot transfer money to Fiji anymore, as this is the only provider who did that 😞\n",
      "31. I wanted to cancel a transaction. The instructions posted from the app are incorrect. There is no cancel transaction option.There was a reason I stopped using WorldRemit back in 2022. I will never use your service again\n",
      "32. Unreliable for sure. I sent money back home as emergency and it took more than a week before my family received my money. Nobody is available when you want to talk with someone. Most of the times they will put you in a very long queue which is very disappointing. So, don’t take a risk . There is a lot of remittance that provides higher rate and much faster and secured than World remit.\n",
      "33. Worldremit is terrible. My account got deactivated because they \"needed some extra documents\", including my payslips, ID card, etc. I sent these and I never got an answer to my email. I kept on trying to contact them via different means, including different email addresses and phone calls. without success. Their attention line has almost always waiting times of more than 30 mins and their specialist can never resolve anything, only forward emails to other teams that are supposed to contact you, but never do. It has been 8 months and my issue has not been resolved. I obviously do not want to use this service anymore; however, I would like to acces my account to retrieve my transaction history for tax purposes. However, this is not possible, since my account is still deactivated. I would recommend you to use Remitly or Revolut. Fast and reliable, so far.\n",
      "34. 2 days has gone and my money transfer hasnt arrived yet.3 days no transfer yet . Trying to call customer service or chat all dead end5 days no transfer yet instead i through live chat my it has been confirmed transfer was never deliverd by lokal partner. Next stage Will be to request refund from refund team. They say it can take 7 working days. Well lets wait and see. Poor my Sister waiting for diabetes medicine money.Day 9 . I got my refund back today\n",
      "35. I agree with most comments that world remit can be good if it works but extremely frustrating when conversation is required.ref no 77634274Can someone from world remit call me.  I encountered a problem today and I chatted with 3 world remit agents. It took 1 hour as the agents rudely leave chat when when you try to read their comment and type in your question.  I asked a simple follow upmquestion.and they kept repeating themselves when I already said that part is clear. After over 1 hour of talking to 3 of their help support, they finally understood my question.and ended up saying I can use a different card.  World remit should read the transcripts.  It was horrible and such a waste of time. Did I mention, I'm a long term customer?  Service is becoming worse to worst.If you can avoid using world remit, please don't.\n",
      "36. I was scammed into setting up the account by someone pretending to be from customer support (booking.com)They walked me through standard security questions like the bank does to gain my information annd they set the account up,  I was then told to enter a number that would appear on my screen and click my Apple Pay butting to get my refund.Ordinarily I wouldn’t do this this but you believe the person on the end of the phone is genuine when they can tell you what the refund was for and how much!!!Not much help to recover this money. Just an email to the receiving bank.It was paid straight out to them before it had even properly left my bank so they were able to withdraw it their side again before it had even properly left my bank. All I was told was “sent an email to the receiving bank and they couldn’t help”That was the end of the matter apparently\n",
      "37. To sign up, you need an Australian phone number..My computer crashed, and I had to get a new ssd. As I had shifted overseas this created alarm bells with WR and I could not rejoin, despite using WR for ages.Now Forced to use Remitly, who give good service but cost me about $20 AUD more than WR.\n",
      "38. The money was received after 48hrs, their phone line did not give any information, I was not able to speak to an advisor.\n",
      "39. I was almost scammed out of £100.00 by someone posing as a customer service representative for a company I was looking for a refund from (I had posted on X on the company page asking for details of how to go about being refunded). Scammer picked up my post and private messaged me posing as a member of the company.Alarm bells started ringing when I was asked to enter my card details via this app, in order to receive a refund of £100.00 (the refund I was due was only 8.10!!). The scammer tried to make out that this was a refund form but it required me to enter my card details to receive the refund - if this had been a genuine customer service representative, they'd have already had my payment details on file against the transaction. There was also a random account name that had been added to the app as a recipient?! So I hung up, deleted the app and immediately changed all of my online passwords etc just in case.If you require further information on the scammer, please let me know. Although no doubt the phone number will be untraceable.\n",
      "40. Calijawhar cabdilahi geedi bahal\n",
      "41. I was scammed under pressure after a fake support call (posing as MediaMarkt refund assistance) walked me through a WorldRemit transaction I believed was a refund deposit.Instead, I was tricked into sending:€199 at 17:44€190.86 at 17:40Total: €389.86, with a further €500 request that I refused.Not even an automated reply to my email. I was completely ignored.These scams rely on platforms like WorldRemit that allow instant transfers, even under suspicious pressure. I’m devastated that your team didn’t even bother to acknowledge the report. That silence screams louder than the loss.\n",
      "42. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER I've been using WORLD REMIT for almost 6 years from NZ paying to SA, in the past 2 weeks 4 transactions has been cancelled. When you talk to the 24/7 chat agents in the APP, they just say it's their local partner that has an issue, they can't help, they dont have control, try again after 24hours but your money will only be refunded in 24 to 48 hours sometimes 7days, call your bank... you name it I have heard it all... I am now deleting WORLD REMIT.... My mom needs this money for her diabetic medication....Not fast and secure as they promise. They are also not allowed to give any information about who their local partner is or how to contact them. This is PATHETIC service to say the least.....\n",
      "43. WorldRemit can be excellent when it works, but very frustrating when it doesn’t.  Their customer service has become ridiculous.  Previously, they answered you promptly if you had a problem and they would resolve it immediately.  Now their “contact us” number makes you go round and round like a fool and eventually drops you out.\n",
      "44. I am appalled that unauthorised transactions totalling £700, 14 times, were taken from my son’s account without any consent. Neither he nor I authorised these payments, and we have no connection to the recipient company involved.Despite reporting this immediately, the issue remains unresolved, and the funds have not been returned. This has caused great distress to our family and raises serious concerns about the security and monitoring of accounts.I strongly urge the company to take responsibility, improve its fraud detection, and refund the stolen money promptly. Customers’ trust is at stake here.14 unauthorised transactions through this website.\n",
      "45. It’s very good and convenient to use Worldremit’s. But as long as you’re abroad there’s no chance to get that help. I struggled for a year whilst I was abroad and couldn’t manage to send money to my relatives, and emergency. It was absolutely devastating.\n",
      "46. Really bad customer service abc the American people company is a scum as they misuse their authority with so called financial law without proper accountability and transparency to let customer know why they cancel orders and ask to try again\n",
      "47. Im still complaining about the same issue, still not addressed. I wrote complaining about not changing my address and preferred currency since March 2025. Then they write back immediately asking me to provide details which are all in the original ticket. Obviously agents cant even be bothered to check on the ticket and see what the unresolved issue is. Really, these required changes take at most 5 mins to do. Give me admin rights and I'll do it myself. Is there a possibility to give them 0 Stars on the ratings?\n",
      "48. They stole my money do not use this company. They switched merchants and paystack has a 48 hour delay. My funds has already been authorised and left my account their dumb agent says it’s my bank issue. Don’t talk bs it’s a paystack issue! How can you use a service provider that takes 48hours to process the transaction. I have been using you for 5 years but this is the last time. I still don’t have my money!!!!!!\n",
      "49. This WorldRemit is just disgusting when it comes to customer services, l have been calling them for hours,there customer care number doesn’t work,the application doesn’t work,you are only left with one option,to cancel the transaction and the refund is not instant,l don’t recommend this to anyone,after cancellation you don’t have any funds left when you only need to rectify a name\n",
      "50. Lately I was having a problem 3 attempts with all the information correct and it gets cancelled , Very frustrating. I’m looking for a different company.\n",
      "51. \"Terrible experience with this app! I created an ID and filled in my details, including my name and passport number. However, after clicking \"next,\" the document upload page failed to load. I waited for 15 minutes, but the screen just froze. When I closed and reopened the app, it showed that my documents were under review - despite not uploading anything! I contacted friends to create an ID, and they faced the same issue. Social media is filled with complaints about the app's slow performance and unresponsive team. Avoid wasting your time!\"\n",
      "52. Bad Company-Poor Customer Service- reduse to send Money without any Tessin and stupid answers.\n",

      "56. Slow and bad app, slow and unhelpful customer service. Don't waste your valuable time with this company use others like Remitly instead!\n",
      "57. You guys are fraud! You steal $400 from my bank account, and I will call the Police to arrest you Criminal!\n",
      "58. When the withdrawal problem wasn't fixed by the letter, the issue was quickly forwarded to Gaard io.\n",

      "60. I made a refund and its been two weeks after the refund even the urgents online they can't solve my issue am so pissed off\n",
      "61. Having used WorldRemit for years without a problem, I suddenly started getting cancelled transactions this year. I requested customer service to look into this several times but they blamed it on the receiver and were not very helpful. The last agent I dealt with rudely ended the chat when I told him that if I didn’t get a solution I would have to use an alternative service. I did just that and my transaction was successful. If you are having trouble sending money to Zimbabwe, I would try Remitly.\n",
      "62. It havent been possible to send money to Kenya for long time\n",
      "63. World remit is not trustworthy and reliable when it comes to refunding , people should stop sending money through world remit otherwise you will lose your money\n",

      "65. Used this app for years.The way names are required has changed.No communication, no option to update names, chat box just stops responding after telling me to wait 3-6minutes, phone line always says out of business hours no matter what time I call. Refund processed and advised funds will be available but nope, money is missing. Last time, refund took 5 monthsOnce this refund is processed I will delete the app. Time for someone else to come up with something better.\n",
      "66. I Had a chat with customer service provider to follow up on my refund as its 14 days delayed as per him its refunded and he ask you to check with apply pay i asked him to offer me copy of chat as proof he ended the chat thinking on his own he already resolved my issue a bad experience after using this app for long years. Didnt expect this kind of service . Wont recommend to anyone. Poor communication.\n",
      "67. I send couple of times for a receiver that I've been doing the transaction for years, it cancel couple of times I just notice if the transaction is a couple of hundred of the dollar it cancel. Numerous times they cancel my remittance I felt so bad coz I thought that world remit is okay but no..\n",

      "71. I've been using this WordRemit to transfer money. But there's something happened last night. Someone was trying to get money from my bank card/account. It's so clearly a hacking. I suggest to WorldRemit to do something with their security enhancement. Now I'm so very disappointed and I uninstalled the WorldRemit app and I do not like to use it again, never ever again. Be careful guys!\n",
      "72. Bad experiences for several weeks now. I am a long time customer. I use it every day.  Now I am very frustrated with lack of response. Before I could call WR by phone. I am in New Zealand. Now they do not answer.  I am mad as hell. Why does the app not work anymore? Its been out of action for some weeks now. No information coming from them at all. I am not happy.\n",
      "73. They lied that money will be in my ecocash within 5 minutes, and this is not true. Chatted before sending the money and they confirmed that I will get the money within 5 minutes.Finally got the money after contacting the receiving end. Looks like they World remit don't know how the system works. It's their job to get information from their partners, thank you. I got my money after 6 nights of sleepless nights.\n",
      "74. I am still waiting to for a refund since feburary 2025. Or an update..  I was informed that they will be in contact with me still nothing  .. Highly dissatisfied in the customer service  !\n",

      "76. Had a fraudulent account opened in my name. Scammers transferred AUD$1000.00 from my bank account into the WorldRemit  account and it took at least 3 hours of chat and phone calls to advise them of it. They tell me the fraudulent account has been marked as such and that the money did not transfer to the scammers and that I would receive the money back. It's been 2 weeks and no sign of the money back into my account. The people at their call centre sounded an awful lot like the original scammers to me. DO NOT use this service if you want security.  For your information. My bank hasn't got the money back, the scammers don't have the money (as per your email). Therefore WorldRemit still has my money, please return it to the account that it was stolen from. Don't email me again unless you give me a direct contact number and have FULLY investigated my issue.\n",
      "77. I was scammed through worldremit & the…I was scammed through worldremit & the advisors were no help at all.They didn’t help me to cancel the transaction or trace the scammer. They just kept repeating that they have no liability.I would avoid this company.Also the advisor underneath requested I contact them so eagerly I did hoping I would get some help.I would not waste your time, the comment is for show & they just repeated the same \"we have no liability\" comment & cant help you.So yet again I've ended up feeling upset & frustrated with this company.I can’t seem to reply to the message underneath so I’ll do it on here.I was scammed on your site, get it.It was supposed to be a refund but they debited from my bank account.You & your advisors wouldn’t cancel the transaction or offer any help apart from repeat smart a**, unhelpful, un-empathic comments like the one below.So again I would reiterate that I would not recommend you to anyone &  to steer clear of this company.\n",
      "78. Im putting one star because there isn't a way to give them zero. Been trying to sort a transaction out for 2 days and keep on getting the same canned statements. Was given a number for complaints and they made me wait for 10 minutes before putting the phone down on me.\n",
      "79. I made a transfer, and today marks the fifth day of delay. Unfortunately, customer care has been extremely unhelpful and unable to provide any assistance.\n",
      "80. sir,in Pakistan after 10days i can t receive my money ....still inrailed  transfer .... how many days i have to wait...????\n",
      "81. I was inquiring about a status of my cancelled transaction for 418059440 and this customer service agent that I am talking with has been very unhelpful. Saying things like cancellation is not guaranteed and that they can not help me if the money does go through. What type of customer service is this? I have been using world remit for the longest time and contacted customer service 2x and they always manage to disappoint me. They don't offer any type of service only more fear mongering and they are not really there to help at all.\n",
      "82. My partner received an text to pay money to Australia post then got ripped off almost 400au from his account and had to close it the account was world remit sydney. I have tried to contact them but it's impossible. This company is used by scammers.\n",
      "83. I send funds to South Africa on 3/6/25 and up to today 24/07/2025 the recipient still hasn't received the funds. World Remit have given me case reference 61243037 but their excuse is they are waiting for an update from their Local Partner - this is now 7 weeks and 4 days!!!!\n",
      "84. I had an urgent overseas transaction, and only after sending the money was I asked to verify my account. This should have been done beforehand to avoid delays.When I reached out for help, the live chat agent was extremely unprofessional and unhelpful. The representative (I believe a female agent) was slow to respond, took long to read my messages, and her tone made it clear she wasn’t interested in assisting me. She kept repeating “wait for an email” without offering any real help or reassurance. To make matters worse, she abruptly ended the chat, saying she didn’t want to waste time.This was a stressful situation made worse by a disrespectful support experience. Very disappointed\n",
      "85. UPDATE on previous post: I remain beyond disappointed with WorldRemit.Recap - On 3 June 2025, I transferred £4k via the app to Pakistan — a transaction promised to complete within minutes. Over a week later, the funds have still not been received by the intended recipient. This money was meant for a life-saving medical procedure.I’ve contacted WorldRemit multiple times since their response below to my previous post and even submitted the recipient’s bank statement showing no deposit. On Friday, an agent admitted the transaction was still pending with the local partner and assured me it was being cancelled. I was told to expect confirmation by email — which never came.In a subsequent live chat (screenshots available), a different agent insisted the funds were “delivered” — offering no proof, no date, no response to evidence, and zero accountability. When I asked for clarification, they simply repeated canned responses and brushed me off.This is unacceptable. There has been:•\tNo traceable proof of delivery•\tNo internal consistency or escalation•\tNo meaningful customer support or resolutionIf a transfer fails and your only response is “our system says it’s done,” how is anyone meant to trust your service?I’ve now had to escalate this to my bank, next steps are the Financial Ombudsman, and am considering further legal options.If you value your money — or basic human decency — AVOID WorldRemit at all costs.\n",
      "86. I was scammed through worldremit & the advisors were no help at all.They didn’t help me to cancel the transaction or trace the scammer.

      "87. 41676991, Sent money to my daughrer in Zambia on the 8th of June through these scammers up to now that money hasn't been paid. Tried to speak to an unprofessional remi online who has no clue about solving customers disputes and no humanity at all. I just wonder which year are they going to give me back my hard earned cash. What a horrible company,  this is. Does destroying innocent customers souls make grow?\n",
      "88. I still give it a 2 star because it took my money on May 17, 2025. They cancelled my remittance without notification sent to me and up to this date, June 7, 2025,  i still don't know why and am still waiting for the refund to go in my bank account. I noticed that every time I check for the status, the date in the status check changes when it was processed. Making it look like they never cancelled. When I checked today, June 7, It still says \"refund processed and it may take up to 3 business days to process.\" With a corresponding date of June 7, 2025. And everyday when I check, it also is up to date accordingly. There is no number to call. And if you call after hours, yes, they are not available. The AI is so narrow minded and will only allow you to ask a few specific questions and then, you hit the wall! I wish i could be more positive but \"matter-of-fact\" review comes out negative. Please refund my money asap!\n",
      "89. Verification time takes long in cases of emergencies\n",
      "90. I’ve been using worldremit for years but this time im very disappointed. Agent I spoke to is unhelpful and end the conversation without a clear answer apart from waiting and been told that were just chatting in circles. It advertised that the processing is only an hour but now its 3rd day and still no answer apart from i have to wait.\n",
      "91. The money was not received by the recipient. The local partner has not paid the recipient. I am extremely worried that i will lose the money I sent. Online their chat service is not helpful and it took 20 minutes to speak to someone on the phone. This issue has happened to the recipient before with other transactions. So will not be using this service and want a refund for the funds they have not delivered.\n",
      "92. The transfers work to some extent. Only the service is under all circumstances.I can't log in and change my email address\n",
      "93. I am trying to see if it will work out\n",
      "94. Good job excellent\n",
      "95. Not a good experience as it causes me a double transaction when I was doing one\n",
      "96. I have been with world remit as a customer over 10 years. I sent money 5 days ago and it is still in progress. I talked to agents twice and both of them told me that there is nothing they can do or tell me since their local partner is responsible for the delay. The agents were so rude and obnoxious. They just told me that I should not call them because they cant help and i made the choice to use their platform. This will be my last transaction with them. I advise you to avoid using world remit at all costs.\n",
      "97. Poor customer service .\n",
      "98. Contrary to what's on WorldRemit's website, it charged me a transfer fee.\n",
      "99. Appalling service ! WR took 6 x $345NZ unauthorized transactions from my account on the same day that I had authorized only one transaction of that amount.I had to contact my bank in order to retrieve the money, which was eventually returned 7 days later . Despite emailing WR and contacting their agents many times in regard to asking them \"How did this happen ?\".  I have received no response.Update 17.6.25 : it took some time but WR have been in contact and resolved the issue satisfactorily. I have reassesed my rating and will continue to use their service.\n",

Is it negligence or is it that someone is not doing his or her job or someone doesn't even care?It's not the first time my transactions are delayed. In all instances, I have came across liars on your chats platform. For today only, I was lied ten times by your agents. One agent even said is not paid enough to follow up such transactions. Seriously?Your South African partners are also something else. How did you come to partner with such incompetent companies? Seriously how?One of them from Hello Paisa asked me why should I phone them when I have problems with my transaction. They told me that Worldremit generates payment without paying their money, and how do they expect to complete transactions?You need to sort yourselves out immediately because there are other competitors out there.Please sort my transaction immediately.Thank you,Mluleki NdlovuHide trimmed content----- Forwarded message -----From: Hello Paisa Inwards Help DeskSent: Monday, 2 June 2025 at 16:34:08 GMT+1Subject: [Ticket #81154] Transaction 416993030 - Not a Hello Paisa TransactionHi Mluleki Ndlovu,The IT team has received your request and will get back to you.

      "101. WorldRemit was a good application for me. But since the beginning of the year they blocked quite a few people who sent money to Mozambique and I am one of them. It was three months of calling and emailing. Had to send a lot of proof such as where you work, pay slip and other things. After answering all the questions and submitting proof I got the following: We have reviewed your account and transaction history, and unfortunately found that it does not meet WorldRemit's approval criteria. That’s because we currently don’t support charitable operations. And so, your account has been permanently disabled, and you’ll no longer be able to use WorldRemit services.Because you help friends and family in need, you are blocked. They also kicked out other friends. What exactly is the problem why people can't send money to Mozambique through you? No, I was a fan worldRemit but that is over.Don't send proof/documents as they say. It's talk, they don't help you get your account back but they have your data.\n",
      "102. Hi is there any problem with WorldRemit right now as I can’t log in to my account.\n",
      "103. They allowed someone to open an account using my email address. I then had to contact them to cancel this. I probably had to provide more information than the scammers who opened the account.\n",
      "104. I have been using WorldRemit for more than 5 years to send thousands of dollars to Zimbabwe and suddenly in February 2025 I couldn't send money anymore. I called the customer service line multiple times over a 4 months period until the case was escalated to Junlyn  but, all got from her on multiple occasions was a generic reply that there is a problem with the \"route\" .I  explained to her that ,that cannot be problem because my siblings are successfully sending money to the same recipients I have been trying to send to. All Junlyn ever did was give me her initial reply which was \"problem with the route\" .The other time she closed sent me WorldRemit terms and conditions to inform me that WorldRemit is not \"liable\" ,instead of trying to find out the solution to a technical problem.The problem was finally resolved a by other competent people on 28.05.2025\n",
      "105. All my transactions have been getting canceled for almost a year now regardless of the recipient. The issue is still not resolved. Customer support is always clueless.\n",
      "106. Rate you provide is not the best and Everytime I have to pay charge. so I use this portal only when I have to send money urgently otherwise not.\n",
      "107. Absolutely horrible experience. Sent money for hospital emergency but after five days saying transaction got cancelled without any updates. I have been calling them and asking about the transaction. After five days they are saying we will refund you when we receive the money back from other country. I am very disappointed and frustrated.i have given all the details over the phone multiple times to Jack(Customer Service)I asked for manager today so i can speak to him and Jake said i can promise you he will call you in a hour. Also you will get the refund today. No call received and no refund yet. they are just lying again and again. I just need my money back ASAP so I can send it from different platform.I will NOT use them again and will let family and friends to do same. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡😡😡\n",
      "108. I want to highlight that the service worked very well since I started sending money frequently and at high rates. However, since last week, I have been encountering repeated problems like this, with my transfers failing multiple times.I previously deleted my reviews because my refund was credited back to my account in less than an hour, and I was able to resend the money. But now, the same issues have occurred again.What’s most disappointing is that it takes 3-7 days to credit the refund back to my account, which is a very long wait. I chose to transact with WorldRemit because of your promise that most transactions would be sent immediately, within minutes, especially since this is an emergency situation. This delay defeats the purpose and causes a lot of stress.I will wait for my refund to be returned to my account and look forward to hearing from you to resolve this ongoing problem.\n",
      "109. No body to take your calls, it may be morning or night time, only AI.\n",
      "110. I have send 2 transactions and didn’t received the payment in to receiver account. THIS IS A BIG SCAM.This is fake and scam app. Didn’t received what I was being told. Pathetic services and not satisfied by the agent either keep repeating the same sentences. ***DO NOT USE THIS APP EVERYONE***\n",
      "111. Remitly is a cheaper service.\n",
      "112. Absolutely terrible experience. I attempted to transfer £500 to India after seeing a competitive exchange rate, only for the transaction to be cancelled without explanation. When I contacted support, they refused to tell me why the transfer was cancelled and casually informed me that I would have to wait 7 days for the refund.Not only did this disrupt an important transaction, but holding my money for days with no clarity is completely unacceptable. This service is unreliable, opaque, and frustrating. Avoid using them if you value your time and peace of mind.\n",
      "113. I received an email from worldremit about a new device accessing my account. I was recommended to check the devices on my account. I contacted the webchat to ask how I can see the device list. Having been kicked out of webchat three times, I was eventually advised to navigate to \"account settings\" to check. I could not locate device security on the mobile app. I contacted the webchat team again who advised they had no line of sight to the mobile app so could not help me. I still do not gave any instruction as to how to navigate to check my devices. I fear a security breach but can do nothing.Please train your support staff on the mobile app. This is basic.\n",
      "114. WorldRemit’s customer service is awful. Their “review process” is vague and unhelpful — no clear reason, no timeline, just silence while your money is stuck. It feels like a scam tactic to delay or avoid payment. I strongly advise others to avoid this platform. Use a more reliable service.\n",
      "115. - I sent money in January and reversed it straightaway - there has been no correspondence. I have called several times  and each time no one can help me . I get answered by someone in the Phillipines. They gave me a customer email they don’t use . They have no supervisor and they keep saying we are working with the agent . It’s been 4 months . I’m in Australia and there is no way of contacting customer service apart from the night time . I have been with you for a while but that service is appalling . They said they would call back straight away on the day last week and I got nothing .I’m asking you I want my money back and there is no one to actually help me get my money back .I’m thinking of reporting you World remit to Ombudsman. This is wrong . And no one seems to have an idea of what’s happening with my transaction .\n",
      "116. I have been using Worldremit for years and it has become a critical part of my international toolset.  Up until about six months ago, it was completely reliable, fees were reasonable, exchange rates were reasonable.For the last six months, though, I have been unable to use Worldremit to send to one of my primary recipients in Kenya.  The transactions cancel within a few minutes - the money is promptly refunded but I have to use another transfer agent.Tech support has been persistently just closing the support tickets without resolving the issue.  They blame M-Pesa or me; M-Pesa blames Worldremit and the issue persists.  Promises to escalate to the \"technical team\" or \"engineering\" never result in any outcome other than yet another ticket closed without resolution and with no evidence of any effort to contact me or actually address the issue.It is a great tool... when it works.  When it doesn't, there doesn't appear to be any path to a resolution.UPDATE:  After my initial review here, Worldremit finally did reach out to me and was able to resolve the issue within 24 hours.  As a result of that, I have updated the rating from 1-star to 3-star.Worldremit has built a global funds transfer infrastructure that is a marvel of design and function and I continue to be in awe of that.  My encouragement to them would be to now consider adopting a customer support escalation process that doesn't require six months of frustration/user blaming and an adverse review on Trustpilot to get them to act.\n",
      "117. It has been 10 business day and still waiting for my refund. Everyday it is just the same excuses\n",
      "118. Why are Funds not available until May 25th?\n",
      "119. Since 2011 i am worldremit costumer, i always sending money to my family every month. I have a very bad concern about my refundable money since 30th of may and we are now june 21  never get back my refundable🤨\n",
      "120. I strongly advise against this method of payment, it's been 1 month and more since I should have received my money from Japan but so far it's still in pending mode, we've relaunched and relaunched and relaunched but it's as if they're making fun of us, the money in question is not an insignificant sum, it's very important, it's a very important sum to pay for many medical expenses etc., I advise against it, I advise against it, I advise against it.I will delete this negative comment if my problem will be solved quickly until then I capture everything and I put on social networks, I wait 24h\n",
      "121. Hi I have been contacted worldremit about a transaction that I cancelled and I haven’t received the refund and it’s been 3 weeks already, I  checked with my bank and I haven’t received anything. Also every time I am waiting to talk with the agent something happens and I can’t send you the  messages, or calls because it said it to already close and I had tried at different times. so it hasn’t been good for me.\n",
      "122. I want to warn everyone against using WorldRemit. They claim you will \"never regret sending money with WorldRemit.\" That is a complete lie! I have never experienced a more amateur and fraudulent company than WorldRemit.Over a month ago, I sent money to my family through WorldRemit. My family has still not received the funds. Whenever I contact WorldRemit, they claim that their local partner confirms the money has been received. This is an outright lie.For over ten days, I have been calling WorldRemit every day, and each time they promise to contact their local partner for proof of receipt. But no proof ever comes. Every day, they tell me that I will receive an email within 24 hours — an email that never arrives.They keep repeating the same excuses. I am convinced they are trying to wear me down until I give up. I have never dealt with a worse company than WorldRemit.If you are considering sending money through them, don’t do it. Choose another, more reliable service because WorldRemit will only give you headaches and frustration.\n",
      "123. Made a transaction month back already send money to numerous time to same account they just failed transaction.  Still waiting for the refund. They are holding my money nearly a month . They said will receive in week but still not received my money back .recommend not to use their service use your bank instead if I Don't receive my money soon I will pass on to fraud prevention team uk.\n",
      "124. On your website you claim that you are using the current interbank exchange rates. However, it is very easy to cross check the real rates and WorldRemit is always approx. 2.5% higher! It is fine to add 2.5% as long as you are being transparent about it. The problem is that it is not mentioned anywhere and the user won’t know it unless he cross checks the real rates.I can see in a previous review I can see a reply from you: “WorldRemit’s rates and fees are dependent on many factors and are updated frequently”. That is such a vague answer! If you use the Interbank Exchange rate and yet your rate comes out 2.5% higher, then you are marking it up one way or another.Wise is also claiming to use Interbank exchange rates and their rates actually come out correctly on their website, so please follow their good example and stop hiding the extra fees for your users or at least mention that you will be adding a markup of 2.5% on the currency exchange. Thank you!\n",
      "125. Highly recommend that if you are a US customer sending money to family in African countries do NOT USE WORLD REMIT. They will deactivate your account and take your money and you will be left with no way of contacting them. Use western union or Wise.\n",
      "126. Terrible customer service wont be using worldremit anymore!!! Rude agent\n",
      "127. Very bad not very helpful i would think twice before using them its been 2 weeks they still haven't sorted my issue\n",
      "128. Worldremit was my best place of sending money to my love ones until resently they blocked my account and ask me to give how i earn money i send them my payslip 2 times i call them still no respond untill today so please never again send money with worldremit they became bogus, not like before i have now very bad  experience with wordlremit i rate them 0 star they are not there for you instade you get argent online in place you talk to them direct I don’t know what they are hiding i tell people never use worldremit.0rate\n",
      "129. It's been over a week that you claimed you were recalling my money. I was initially told 3-5 day. Now you are saying it's 60 days. This is not good. I need my money.Case: 11147248Transaction: 414603864\n",
      "130. I usually make transfers on Fridays' and weekends, these tend to take much longer, sometimes 4days. I recently had to complete a mandate which I did not realise until 5 days later. It took me another 10 days to sort it out.Apart from this the service it's usually efficient.\n",
      "131. Can’t even register on the  app. Stop the glitch in your system. Been hours trying to get registered\n",
      "132. Was surprised by the fact that corporate cards, even debit cards weren’t accepted. To fulfill this obligation I had to use a personal credit card, which cost an additional dollar amount and another fee besides that…with no explanation as to why.\n",
      "133. Very poor service, incompetent staff in the support team, no matter who you end up with everyone reads the same text from their list, world remit must be banned\n",
      "134. Didn’t get the money until today\n",
      "135. The rates are good the first time you send money but they keep going down subsequently. I contacted customer service and they were rude plus they couldn’t help me. Rates should fluctuate, meaning they should go up or down…but that is not the case with them. Rates go bad and worse with each transfer!\n",
      "136. Customer Service hung up on me!  Live agent chat waited 20 minutes for Ryan to tell me they had issue and he couldn’t do anything!  Is there a rating of “0”?\n",
      "137. Very, very poor serviceA lot of talking no reliable statements, all just excuses, German service number does not work, Dutch hotline connects further to the USAAll lies, no processing for 2 weeks, promised 48 hours\n",
      "138. My money is not delivered for 8 days. The system says delivered, Still waiting, customer service is awful 😖Never again\n",
      "139. Transfer process and customer service are terrible. I've been sending money to the same person using the same bank account. Some transactions they will approve and some transactions they deny. Per CSR, a computer makes the decision and they cannot say exactly why the computer denied my transactions. Money Gram and Western Union are better services. If you need to send money for an emergency through World Remit you're taking a big chance the recipient will never receive your money.\n",
      "140. Worst rimetance my hubby send me money but it is a month now did not receive.and it is been cancelled untill now they did not do the refund he keep on trying to send emails it is worst that you think the customer service\n",
      "141. Very unprofessional staff on call centre fake company use people money they hold my money for more then two weeks and then said your recipient bank cancelled transaction  and when i asked reason why they cancelled so they said we don't have reason which totally wrong I called my bank in Pakistan and they they didn't cancelled any transaction.Remember this company just used people money and scam with people so guys be careful use different apps to send money in abroad. Many thanksPoor call centre\n",
      "142. I used WorldRemit for the first time and my transaction has been on hold for over 2 days. Live chat ends in the middle every time, and there’s no clear update. I called and spoke to someone named Harry who said there are no delivery partners in Pakistan right now. When I asked if the app should even be used for Pakistan, he got rude and almost started arguing. Really unprofessional experience. Not recommended for sending money to Pakistan.And guess what after waiting for 3 days they cancel my transaction without any issue lol, they are just playing with your money, they are out of there mind, specially there customer support which is worst ever I have experienced, now I am desperately waiting for my refund, please stay away from them.\n",
      "143. app Not longer usable! Deleted and wouldn't recommend,Looking at other reviews it seems like from the last few months they has been a rise in negative reviews and lots of clients are unhappy with poor communication from world remit. To make mutters worse they company wont give any explanation to why its holding people's money or deactivating clients accounts.I suggest finding other app to use as world remit is done out here.\n",
      "144. my accounts was deactivated, i was told to check email for why that happened, checked and they was not email sent to explain waited few weeks then called only to be told we cant tell you why but we cant offer you our service nomore ! Felt helpless as i have been using the app over 5 years just to deactivate my account and no give me a reason felt personal to me\n",
      "145. This is already the second time I have to leave a negative review here for World Remit. The reason is that the transfers made do not take a few minutes as promised, but instead take days or hours. And beforehand, I was not informed that certain types of transfers could take up to 3 days for the recipient to receive the money. When I then contacted a customer service representative to ask what was causing the delay, I was told to contact Trustly to speed up the process and was brushed off, even though I had questions that needed clarification. I am very, very disappointed with how customers are treated, and I cannot recommend this app to anyone.\n",
      "146. My account does not work and i cannot contact customer support\n",
      "147. I have been using WorldRemit for over 2 years. If I won't get my REFUND ASAP - I will use another international transfers and remove WorldRemit.I haven't gotten my refund and everytime I call or go to Chat - no one is live, everything is automated. The CANCELLED for REFUND was April 13 and it's already MAY 1ST!\n",
      "148. Horrible experience and would advise against using.  I can't see why they are recommended by FORBES. I tried to transfer...my transaction was canceled. They won't tell u why it is canceled or give you a clue how to fix. It is unusable service and not at all customer friendly.  I will use other providers and suggest not to waste time on this one.\n",
      "149. This is a follow-up to my earlier review, and things have only gotten worse. It’s been over a week now, and WorldRemit is still holding my hard-earned money hostage.After several failed attempts to reach someone, I finally got a callback from one of your agents who told me the refund had been processed and I should check with my bank. I did exactly that — and my bank confirmed that no refund has been received.I then called WorldRemit’s contact centre again today, and this time a different agent told me the cancellation was still pending on your end and he had just sent an escalation request to get it sorted. So now I’m getting conflicting stories — and still no money.I don’t know who to believe anymore. Meanwhile, my family is still waiting for the funds, and I’m left chasing WorldRemit for my own money. This is unacceptable. Please refund my money immediately — enough of the delays and excuses.\n",
      "150. The money took long, which is disappointing considering it was supposed to be used urgently.\n",
      "151. I have been and still a regular customer about 5 years now, the service was great and the transfers used to be in minutes, since they (worleemit) get in odds with ZAAD service, they started punishing their customers by delaying transfers of anyone who uses that ZAAD option in the app. If you don't want your customers use that service why don't you just remove it from your app instead of punishing your customers and holding their transfers for days without explanation? I used to recommend family and friends use this service but I myself is at the point of stopping using it at all. Do you guys not know that there are other competitors in the Market now? I am considering paySiin now.Another problem is, they don't have local office and they will never give you their local partner contacts and no one will pick up the number they listed as contact, I have been calling the US number for hours.The only way you can get hold with them is a chat and the agent will say they contact local partner which takes days too\n",
      "152. I had a bad experience with world remit they cancelled my transfer & nobody know why , the customer service office I spoke could not explain anything to me  he was not a welcoming person\n",
      "153. I chatted with one of your agents about a week ago to change my phone number and after the phone number was successfully changed, I have not been able to login. Whenever I want to login, it says my account has been temporarily deactivated. I could not use the online chat in the app to resolve this issue because I could not login. Please, assist with the activation or direct me to who can assist.I have called the contact number for South Africa but could not get through to an agent. I also sent an email to customer care but no response.\n",
      "154. I give to a orphanage in Africa & a Church in the Philippines feeding homeless children [there's over 1 million homeless children in the Philippines], for no reason I was suspendedYou make me sick\n",
      "155. accessibility doesn't work. Telefon und live chat not working.I send money and did not receive and confirmation and the money was not received.First i asked, Where ist my money?\n",
      "156. While the transfer process is good their customer service is terrible. They put my account on hold for transfering money from my own salary account to family in India. If you really has concerns transfering the money you could have asked the same details before initiating the transfer in the app. Your support keep sending emails asking the documents with out even reviewing the provided docs. Despite multiple attempts could not connect with you support team due to long wait times. Pathetic customer experience..\n",
      "157. When my money was held for a random \"review\" for 3 days, I tried contacting their so-called overseas contact centre. First, the opening hours are ridiculous and confusing. After hours of trying to navigate their IVR voice recordings, I could never actually speak to a real person. It's like they deliberately make it impossible.I also tried their \"24-hour\" chat support — what a joke. It took 1–2 hours just to get connected to someone, and when I finally did, the agent disappeared halfway through the conversation without helping me. No follow-up, no proper customer service. Just complete silence.So if you are ever in an emergency and your transaction is on hold, the only option you really have is to pray and wait while they hold your money hostage. No urgency, no responsibility.Absolutely terrible experience sending money to India with WorldRemit. Never again.\n",
      "158. It has been a hell recovering my money ever since you removed the edit option as the money for canceled transactions is not getting back into account of origin.  World.remitt blame the bank and the bank blame world remitt.  I don't even know where my money went to.\n",
      "159. Worst company to deal with. I sent a transfer and they held it for a compliance check..  sent all documents and they won't send or refund.. just use your money and then mess you about. Still awaiting a refund of my transfer money... it's been 10 days.\n",
      "160. Please, I really need to understand what’s wrong.Don't you allow other countries to send money to Nigeria again??Coz Someone is trying to send me money from the USA, and I’m in Nigeria but your system won’t allow it. Why?This isn’t the first time this app has failed me. Either you cancel the payment or show an error.I needed the money tonight to buy medication for my ulcer, but once again, it didn’t go through.Instead, The person got this message:\"Sorry, at the moment we are unable to send your money this way.\"Why?Why does this keep happening? It’s painful  I’m honestly just tired and heartbroken.\n",
      "161. I used their service to transfer funds to a mobile phone in Cameroon. I paid a fee of 21.99 CHF for a transfer amount of 1'000'000 CFA (roughly 1500 CHF)With Western Union, there would have been a flat fee of only 3.99 CHF.But that's not all: The exchange rate of World Remit was worse than the one of Western Union. The difference for a transfer amount of 1'000'000 CFA was a staggering 16 CHF.Altogether, with WorldRemit I paid totally 34 CHF more than I would have paid with Western Union. That's a lot.The positive side: The transfer of the money was at least sucessful.\n",
      "162. Very bad experience I sent money to my mum for medication still not received it’s more than 2 weeks\n",
      "163. Didn’t like the way money was on hold for 3 days.\n",
      "164. Very poor!!! Lying about where the money would land. On the website/app says it will land on hormuud when you send your money the receiver would get call demanding to open new SIM card from somtel!! So funny how can they ly so open they should get charge for false advertising very poor! It’s many new/old service like WorldRemit that are legit so people stop sponsoring these bad false WorldRemit and the customer service is a joke!! Use other companies they are much better then this shit\n",
      "165. Worst service ever, I did an international transfer but due to the receiver not being able to collect the money, the transaction had to be cancelled. I haven’t received my refund since 8 January 2025 and now it’s 20 April 2025. I requested for a refund for about six times now and all they are good at is giving excuses. Please save your money.\n",
      "166. I found that World Remit used to be easier to interact with than it is now.  Not exactly sure what has changed, but liked it better before.  Thanks for asking.—— Don Ziegler (412-956-2660)\n",
      "167. worldremit broke all the records for the worst service provider of all time. i tried to send mobile money transfer (412566787 transaction #)  on April 15 at 11:16am and it is still in progress, its been 5 days almost and they keep telling me to wait and making excuses like they are waiting for an answer from local partner. Now they started closing the chat on me without even answering. All the managers are liars too. they promised me to have it resolved in 24 hours and notify me via email 2 days ago yet nothing has been done, this isnt the first time.Last time i tried to send money on March 26( transaction # 410548055 )  they kept making excuses for 4 days and finally on March 30th they said sorry we cancelled your transfer and it cant be delivered so we will refund the money which took another 3 days to reach me. i have screenshots and worldremit app shows everything to prove my word. this is unacceptable\n",
      "168. I have sent payment of 1000gbp to my personal account in pakistan on 4th of april with worldremit it says on thier website its delivered however i have not received it yet.first they told me that instructions gone to mistakenly to somalia and they have corrected it on 8th april after then i still didnt received it then i was told its held by thier local partner and they have sent a query and it should be returned to me within 7 working days which was on 17th april in meantime i have called them 3 times and they ignored to look into matter and told me to wait till Thursday 17th april however when i not tried to reach them chat assistant told me they cannot find any transactions in my account and they cannot find it and closed the chat.please avoid using them they are deceivers and thiefs who will take you money and you will not get it back.i will be taking legal action and will be going to thier office in london\n",
      "169. I always struggle sending money with Worldremit, the money can’t reach recipients without contacting Worldremit. As I am writing this I sent money on17th April and I got receipt and the email telling me that money has landed but still now the recipient did not receive the money. I’ve chatted with more that 3 Worldremit agents but no one has helped me out.\n",
      "170. I lost my money.  I've done an international money transfer, then they cancelled the transaction. I haven't received my refund. Its two weeks now. Careful with world remitt.\n",
      "171. My transfer took almost 2 weeks as I was incorrectly told by an agent it was because of a system issue. Only when I engaged a second time, I was correctly told the receiving party needed to sign something and was provided an incorrect WR25 number. I had to again engage asking for the correct WR25 number which helped move the transfer along.\n",
      "172. The help service on this app is pathetic! If you look at the options there is no other option of contacting them than to ring them. On their website, you cannot find an email address or chat directly with anyone. Please be very careful when using this service, as it is not possible to get connected to customer service apart from ringing them if you need any support.\n",
      "173. Well, Thy just have the mobile application use, we can't money or use their service using the computer or laptop that's a very bad option & a disadvantage. In today time where internet is the key to sucess we can't only rely on mobile phone what if a person who don't have a smart phone & have a computer & want to send money in this case we can't use there service. Bad choice...\n",
      "174. I've used multiple times for years but had a terrible live chat experience with agent cyrell, so I would say service is ok but customer service is 0/10.. honestly that conversation via live chat has put a sour taste in my mouth when it comes to worldremitalso very slow processing times to receive transfer\n",
      "175. This  the worst  app.I sent money to  someone  and they  take  too longAnd after I cancelled.  I took  me to wait 2 weeks.I will  never  ever  recommends  anyoneThis  shit app\n",
      "176. Transaction ref # 412420294Remittance failed inspite of this being repeat of another exact transaction. One reached and this was failed. This company blamed on local partners...not sure why the 1st trasaction went fine then.Getting refund especially £4000 back is ball ache. The company kept blaming the bank. When asked for transaction reference for refund to share with bank, the chat would mysteriously drop or blame the database to down when called on the phone.I incurred a financial penalty for not completing the trasaction. Lost the rate at which the remittance was booked and no access to £4k of my cash for day together.I have now logded a complaint with financial ombudsman. I would urge others to do the same. You can point terms and conditions as excuse for pure complacency.Avoid this company at all cost.\n",
      "177. Tbh my experience with WorldRemit is not good it happened so many times already that I send money it’s say on the emailed that was send it’s ready but it took many days sometimes was even a week for my family to receive the money I send, I am not going to send money back home using this remittance anymore…\n",
      "178. The person I sent the money to claim they didn't recieve it.but I will use ur service again. I never had this happen before.\n",
      "179. No support or refund\n",
      "180. About three months ago, 16,000 Swedish kronor was sent to Kenya. A digit in the recipient's phone number was wrong. The money never reached the recipient but was left hanging somewhere. We have tried to contact you several times without any real result. The money has apparently not been paid out to anyone else but you have kept it in some way. The sender in Sweden is Lerum Aspen Rotary Club/Ann-Charlotte Persson. (I Silvana Ljung have sent for many years before and it has worked well). My request is that you pay back/withdraw this money to our account in Sweden, so we can pay the money to Kenya with the correct phone number. Yours sincerely Silvana Ljung\n",
      "181. I have been waiting for months for a reply from them regarding the blocking of an account used to scam people.Still no answer, it seems their anti-fraud part doesn't exist, a bank that works for scammers.If you are a scammer I recommend it, you are 100% sure they will not block your account. I have never seen such a bad bank.\n",
      "182. Update 3 days later: WorldRemit is not helpful at all!First of all I had to download the app to get in contact with them. Then I tried the 24/chat. They told me to contact by phone, because they could not help me in the chat. I tried the phone. After waiting for 15 minutes I was connected to a lady who told me that they cannot see where my money went to, because there is nothing connected with my account . I did have a number with WorldRemit from the same day, because I had to download the app. Of course there cannot be any transfers related to my account.Conclusion: They let thieves use them, do not give you the informations where and to whom your stolen money went to, and tell you they can do nothing about that!\n",
      "183. I wish I could attach a screenshot! I sent £400 to South Africa 7 days ago and yes I made an issue with the name of the receiver but I cancelled the transaction (which got approved). The app says 24 hours. Live chat says 7 days? So which is it??? I contacted them on the 7th day to be told they are sorry but the transaction is still pending and then the agent just left the chat before I was able to ask any further questions. I also have another payment outstanding for £13 that hasn’t yet been sent to the receiver. Yet other transactions I have done since have gone through.  Really not happy with the live chat service and being told different time frames.\n",
      "184. I have used WorldRemit for 5 years. Recently I have come across an issue where my transfer wasn't successful and I tried reaching out to their customer services via phone call. No one picks up even during operational hours and live chat is so poor on the app that you need to stay on the app otherwise the app just decides to freeze and you end up starting another chat.\n",
      "185. Took 14 hours to deliver money to a bank account\n",
      "186. I have been doing money transfers via world remit for about 3 years.. very recently I sent a transfer of $55.74 to a recipient in Nigeria for a purchase I made… however the recipient didn’t receive the money… it didn’t reflect in her account… I contacted world remit and reported the issue and they stated that they will get in touch with the recipient’s local bank which is access bank in Nigeria and they never did.. instead I received an email stating that the case has been closed and that as far as they’re concerned meaning world remit the amount was credited.. so in summary my $55.74 didn’t make it to the recipient’s account.. where is my money? So be very careful if you ever use their service…\n",
      "187. I was scammed by someone using this app and can't seem to get a refund or any sort of support***Update 18th April - Someone has been unwell touch and asked me to contact the fraud department so I'll possible change my review depending on if I'm refunded\n",
      "188. I have done a transfer on 13th April which has still not reached. The response I get from customer service is not convincing. I am worried about the way my transaction is being managed and delay is blamed to local partner and no updates provided.\n",
      "189. Recipient never received the notification message money was ready for pick up\n",
      "190. I am using world remit for almost 1year now and I noticed that the rate went down a lot lately, the world rate for PH is still $57.68 but in the app it shows only $55.57 it is very low compare to the exchange rate for ph to dollar , why is that?\n",
      "191. Worldremit worked fine unless they blocked my account. They wanted to see my income. I provided a bank statement. After that no reaction, no reply of email. So customer service is dead.\n",
      "192. The app is very secure, it's very good. But last time I found a surcharge of 12$ for using a credit card plus 3,99$ usual. The truth is that I did not receive any notification of the change and there is no information on the website about this money increase.\n",
      "193. I sent money with World Remit to Nigeria on 27 and 28 March. The receiver has not received the money into their account Ecobank. I have even sent Worldremit the receivers bank statement but I have not received a response their customer service is really disappointing you are sent from pillar to post with no solution.I want a refund as the funds have left my bank account and have not be paid over to the receiver\n",
      "194. Always late delivery\n",
      "195. With the previous transactions I’ve had with World Remit sending to the Philippine (M Lhuillier), the transactions have been a mess especially for the recipients. World Remit says the money is available for pick up but MLhuillier say their status of the transaction is “pending”. This forces recipients who I’m trying to give financial support to to go home without receiving their money. That’s wasted travel time and money for people who probably do not already have anything. There was once a transaction where it took days for the money to become available for pickup. Whether World Remit or MLhuillier is at fault here, this delay issue needs to get fixed. This service has become unreliable and burdensome to the people we are trying to help. Instead of recipients getting their money, they instead suffer helpless situations at their pick up locations.I do not discount the reliability of this service before when money was actually ready to get picked up once the App tells you the money is ready. I just hope the issue is fixed and that World Remit can be trusted again as a reliable money service.\n",
      "196. Poor customer service\n",
      "197. After I sent money someone sent over $1000 using the method of sending just after I sent it!\n",
      "198. If only I could give zero star. Aparntly due to Technical Error the money I sent ended up in the wrong bank, which that bank has refunded which only happened upon me contacting World remit after 11 days of waiting for the payment to reach the recipient. Now the Willy wonkas in their customer service are telling me to contact my own bank to Pre-auth a refund! This company is a joke. If I do not receive my refund by end of this week, I will report you to FCA.\n",
      "199. The service is really poor. They have a customer service which is unreachable. Please use for transfers at your risk. I will not be using them again. Over my dead body.\n",
      "200. Useless system. Money sometimes does not go through and only diplomatic answers are given! Not productive in any way!Money sent for a wedding was delayed because of a ‘ Technical issue’! We will resolve it ASAP! Never got resolved!!! Same recently sent for someone’s medical treatment!\n",
      "201. Money never arrived, and refunds take over two months. Customer service is unprofessional. Avoid this company, especially for sending money to Somalia, as they can't operate there. Until they respect Country sovereignty.  Please refund money ASP.\n",
      "202. This used to be good transfer company but looking at my last 2 transfers on 30/3/2025 and 4/4/2025 this company can't be trusted very poor service DO NOT USE  find other ways\n",
      "203. I registered with WR on the 7th of April only to decide later in the day to use an alternative provider. I attempted to cancel. I tried to establish how to cancel from the website which was very unclear. I managed to establish I needed to call customer service. I called and was put on hold with a intermittent message telling me my wait time was increasing each time. I called later the same day and the same thing happened. I went back to the website and saw the customer service line was open for 2 hours each day - 10am - 11.59am. I called back the next day at 10.42 am to hear a message that customer care was closed and open between 10am and 11.59am - clearly not. I tried again at 10.48, same message. I called a 3rd time at 11.12 am and after a short time a operater answered. I requested to close my account. He asked for my details and left me holding. He returned and stated my account was closes and I would rececive email confirmation in 2 hours. It is now the 9th April and no email received and I have checked and my account is still open! This will be reported to the FCA today\n",
      "204. Transfers via Airtel Money to the DRCongo not available!\n",
      "205. 3 days since a small transfer from NZ to Aus bank account, still no signs of it.Done Fri, and it’s Wed today!\n",
      "206. I transferred some money and it was never arrived. I talked 4 times with worldremit customer care and they were so rude every time and didn’t solve my issue. I’m not using this shit anymore.\n",
      "207. They now charge a fee 0.99 pence to send money abroad to a mobile phone from the UK.No advance notice\n",
      "208. I requested my statements several times and all I got were promises.Maybe I should help from the regulating authorities.\n",
      "209. I previously used this platform for currency exchange due to its competitive rates and timely delivery. However, I have recently experienced longer delivery times and significantly lower exchange rates compared to competitors. Additionally, this platform charges delivery fees, while others do not. As a result, I no longer use this service and have turned to alternatives that offer better rates and quality.\n",
      "210. I sent some money yesterday into my account in Pakistan and I still have not received it\n",
      "211. I made a transfer today evening 5th April 2025. While it has successfully deducted money from my bank account, the transaction suddenly cancelled! I did not receive any email whatsoever! I’ve checked all recent transaction in my Worldremit App and this transfer that i made just now is not listed there! No record, no transaction number, nothing at all! I only receive an email that saying the details of my recipient has been updated in my account, while i did not touch anything! I did not change anything! How can you refund or process my money if there’s no record at all in worldremit app! My bank account has been successfully deducted! Can someone contact me to fix this issue.I will wait for this to be resolved asap.\n",
      "212. A person can not send money direkt to an account\n",
      "213. Poor customer support! I raised my concern on the recent transaction, said the she can see the transfer amount (pre-authorisation) and have to call the bank. I called my local bank and bank informed that the said amount has already transferred to the account (worldremit). I contacted WR support, but I was not able to connect, it takes 7 times attempt for me to connect the bot and transferred to agent. The agent(Anne) told me the same thing but when i told her that i contacted the bank and the transfer was successfully done. In the end,She admitted that there is an issue in the system to create the transaction, and have to wait, and if i cant hear the update from them within 24hrs, the amount will be refunded. Such a waste of time and to go through all the hassle but the end of the day issue is not resolve, the purpose of Worldremit its not deliver to your customer. You need to put contact number for your customer to call, i mean a reachable contact number, as the number you provided “not in service”, you cannot rely to the “bot” and online chat support. Bad experience ！\n",
      "214. If the sender can able to amend the name if mistakenly occurred will be more helpful. It’s an easy fix but you make the whole process difficult.\n",
      "215. Everytime you chat for follow up and they know your case you will always get disconnected. And they will tell you that they will update you for 48 hours but never will. So my issue took more than 2 weeks probably more than that if am not consistent of following it up. Coz they won't reach out to you believe me. You have to call or chat again in order you can get your issue resolved which btw am not happy with the result. They gave me  $3.99  as a compensation for a $35 voucher i was complaining since i asked if can even get compensated.So that will tell you how they value their customer.\n",
      "216. you guys scammed me my recipient still hasn't received that money. I'm going to warn a lot of people about youWorldRemit-overschrijvingsnummer: 411100467please refund my money75,43 euro\n",
      "217. I sent money with World Remit yo Zimbabwe on 28 March. The receiver was turned back as Mukuru Zimbabwe informed her they did not have the transaction number in their system. I have been ringing World Remit for over a week to get my money back. Please stay away from them! Use Western Union or Money Gram. World Remit is a scam!\n",
      "218. Taken amount from sender and promised to pay it in India but did not fulfilled the promise and feel cheating with wrong currency conversion rate and going to take this idiot to find lawful resolution as this is not acceptable at all.Transfer number: 411422070Dated 03/04/2025Reason given : FraudAsked under pre-action protocol notice about who is fraudster and why cancelled the transaction after confirmation and stand firm on my believe that the company is fraud not me and ready to bring this in the court of law.\n",
      "219. The app freezes every time, then, when I leave it and start it up again, I have to give my login data. Now I get a popup saying there are technical problems. But I got the same thing two days ago. This company doesn't get its act together. I had good experiences in the past, but since you can only use the app on the phone, things have gone downhill. There are also a number of bugs, too many to mention.\n",
      "220. I sent money to South Africa on Sunday 30/03/2025 and my recipient has not yet got the money till now. It’s almost a week. When l try to call your London office, you take callers to an automated service. No one to speak to . The automated message just says the money is still processing ??? What’s going on? Very frustrating!\n",
      "221. The money did not reach the recipient. Of course the logical thing to do is reach out to them. Keeps insisting that the money was delivered. I also told them that no one got anything or it might be delivered to the wrong person. They told me they would get back to me. Still no updated till now. I feel scammed!\n",
      "222. My money hasn’t arrived to my receiver and we’re now on 6days of waiting.I asked and chatted to an agent every single day for the past few days and an answer is to wait and will get back to me through email. Until now, I’m still waiting.I called an agent and the same answer received from her. When I said about my frustration and stress, she was in a hurry to finished the conversation. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n",
      "223. I made a money transfer from USA to Philippines. They said it would take 1 hour. It's been 15 hours and I still haven't received my money. Their online customer service is not very rude and no help.\n",
      "224. I feel this app is horrible. I signed up to transfer funds from US to Tanzania. I sent a small initial amount from a debit card without a problem. I then sent a larger amount from a second account that had a different billing address than my WorldRemit account. That flagged my transaction as fraudulent and my account was disabled. I contacted WorldRemit to rectify the problem and I was told that I would hear back in 24 hours. I heard nothing. I contacted them again and was told I would hear back in another 24 hours. I heard nothing. I contacted them three days later. It was still under review. At which point the operator put me on hold and two minutes later I was told my account was closed. I have nothing good to say about this company. I rarely leave reviews, let alone a bad review and I am always one to give the company the benefit of the doubt. But not this time. To be accused of fraud because I used a debit card with a different billing address than the one on my account is absurd. Do not use this company.\n",
      "225. I sent 3 transactions since the 28 march till today the receiver has not received any payment, it says in progress once I got their help page it says service outage. Fix the issue please this is nonsense. If I want to cancelled my transaction it says I will have to received my money after 7 days what nonsense is this?. I will stop using you guys if you don’t fix my issue today.\n",
      "226. Recipient didn't get their money after 3 days which meant to be the same day money transfer and I have to email few times and used the live chat so so the service is not reliable.\n",
      "227. The app freezes when trying to make a payment. Registered a second account on a different device and now both accounts are deactivated. Have not made any transactions. The rates offered are great though...for marketing purposes I suspect.You ask what went wrong...I'll know when something actually happens...so far just wasted time on this. I think I'll have to stick to Remitly.I've been asked to get in touch with more details...that's nice except there is no way to do so. the 24/7 in App support is fantastic if you can get into the App and I guess I'll have to call someone during the week! I hope they have nice music to listen to whilst I wait...\n",
      "228. I can't transfer money into my personal account from uk to my account in Ghana.  Customer service cannot explain.\n",
      "229. I have used World Remit for years and transfer a lot of money to Cameroon where most of my family still lives. In the beginning it was great. But presently, customer service is non-existent. I was told that my wait time is 1 hour, really ? I have tried to cancel transactions a couple of times after sending mobile money to the wrong number but unsuccessful . I have  lost substantial amount of money after sending money to a wrong mobile number. Presently, I have deleted the app and now hoping for my bank to help meUpdate: I received a call from 425-390-4107 claiming to be from World Remit, however said he will issue me a refund via another \"sister\" app Ria. However, he went ahead and changed my Ria app account password and tried to withdraw money from my bank account . The recipient of the money is Hildete Pereira in Davie, Florida, while I am in Ohio . It sounded very suspicious. Trustpilot and World Remit should defend their brand if this is not legit.\n",
      "230. My recipient hasn’t received the money yet.I tried to reach Costumer Service but not possible.\n",
      "231. We Need more Banks in Guatemala\n",
      "232. I like the easy and seamlessness with which the funds were transferred and received.  I don’t like the size of the fees being charged.  The fees are quite high especially if one uses your service quite often.  This is why I find it difficult to send money as much as I would like.  I wish there were discounts or preferential rates for loyal customers.\n",
      "233. Sucks! Is there a scum going on? Hopefully, account is secure!\n",
      "234. Never got any email about the transfer.\n",
      "235. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced. After two years of regularly sending money to my family, they suddenly requested additional information. I provided everything they asked for, but now—three months later—I still haven't received a reply, despite sending multiple follow-up emails.As an alternative, I asked my wife to send the money instead. Unfortunately, that money is now lost, and customer service has been unwilling or unable to assist us in tracking down how their partner misplaced it.\n",
      "236. Nothing went wrong, am happy with the way everything just went fast . Keep it up!\n",
      "237. Until recently I was very satisfied with wordl remit, lately I can no longer make a transfer to the UK. I heard that wordl line world remit would no longer support. Recently tried to transfer money but no response, tried to chat with life chat.. a disaster\n",
      "238. It takes nothing short of a miracle to speak to a human being!!! I called the correct number and they placed my call on hold. Instead of my waiting time decreasing, my wait time increased!!!!! I have NEVER dealt with a company that is so customer UNFRIENDLY!!!!\n",
      "239. The agent who assisted me was very rude, named Beverly, and also had to leave the chat. I was worried that my money is still not received by may parents because it will be used for my grandmother’s burial but she said things that are not helpful and told me to cancel my transaction instead.Response to no reply email sent to me the other day:Hi Worldremit,It was such a stressful transaction this time around, I wasn’t in the best place and the agent who assisted me has got no compassion or whatever, I was going to give a great review to Dexter who assisted me the first time I had an issue but the agent named Beverly was just outward rude. I hope you deal with these kind of employees appropriately. This might be a reason to move to another service provider. It was such a bad experience for me.Kind Regards,Marie\n",
      "240. Once again I’m coming back to this platform to express my disappointment with World Remitt money services.  I had  received an email reply from my earlier claim with your fraud department telling me to call the main office for further assistance and to identify my self and the account, which I did. That was March 11th and so far nothing has been resolved. I’m warning my Somali/Simaliland community around the world not use this company. They had scammed me over 2000$ out of my debt card, don’t be another victim. There are scammers who infiltrated and embedded in their offices. If they really want to investigate a fraud , all they have to do is to go back that phone call I made on February 12 2025.Your phone call disclaimer says: all phone calls are being recorded for quality and training purposes. Listen that phone call and there you have it, one of your agent asking me to provide him my 3 digit security code. That is what you call unsuspecting and naïf customer. Five  years of trust evaporated in just one phone call.\n",
      "241. Money has gone missing, they don’t provide updates, chats constantly getting disconnected and when you call they give you the same answer. No updates by text or email. Money has been missing for over a week with no explanation\n",
      "242. Juba Express. Terrible service that reflects poorly quality n you.\n",
      "243. I feel that if you make a spelling mistake on a receiver name and you cancel the transaction- the refund takes longer. Needs to change.A few months ago.\n",
      "244. I would stay away from Worldremit! Literally the worst money transfer! They charged my credit card for a cancelled transaction after the transaction was stuck for more than a week! Now my credit card is charged with over 1500€ and worldremit isnt giving me the money back! Their customer service is absolutely useless and giving excuses only! Stay away if you can...\n",
      "245. One heck of a great deal\n",
      "246. World Remit they are no longer sending text messeges to the pedson whos receiving money.I think they need to prove on that one.sometimes we will forget to send the receiver a text.\n",
      "247. Your app would not allow me to change my friend’s phone number and when I tried your help site it was useless for my needs. I then tried to reach an agent and it asked me if I was still in the queue but when I clicked on yes nothing happened and I could not exit the page. I tried this twice and both times I had to shut off my phone and restart it to get clear of your site. Everything seems to work well if one is sending to the same person frequently and I did that earlier yesterday, sending to another individual!\n",
      "248. Four weeks ago, WorldRemit locked my account due to a review and requested personal documents which I snet them immediately. They did not answer nor they acknowledged, so I mailed them one week later. Still no answer.I phoned them two weeks ago, but were hardly able to understand the lady's dialect as she talked very fast. I asked her multiple times to slow down speed of talking, but she didn't so I asked, if we could kindly proceed sending mails. She requested even more personal documents, which I sent.One week after, I asked WorldRemit by mail, how things are proceeding as they still did not answer. On Thursday I mailed them, that I want to get this issue solved until Friday or they kindly close my account, delete all personal documents and acknowledge this to me. They didn't.So now, I have to admit, I am absolutely unsatisfied with their behaviour. My fiancée and me needed a platform so send and receive money. It worked for a long time. Now they suddenly cut that channel down without any reason. I did submit all information they needed. Even more. But they acted in an arrogant way, which is not only not to understand, but also very impolute und not reliable.\n",
      "249. World Remit transfer to Ghana transaction number 405608276.  Money still not delivered since 3 February 2025.On 13 February 2025 WorldRemit asked for a mobile money statement from my recipient which I forwarded to WorldRemit on 14 February 2025.I got a voice message from WorldRemit on my phone on 18 February 2025 saying that they would send me an email as I could not pick their call. I tried to call back (+61279087837) but got a message saying I was calling outside their work hours.  I re-tried several times and got the same message on different times on different days.I followed up with emails to WorldRemit on 27 February and 7 March 2025 (to the email address they gave me).  No response.  I am still waiting for WorldRemit to refund me my money.\n",
      "250. After many years they suddely deactivate the account with no warning or mail or anything and if you call them they know shit and say you need contact them in the app wich you cant login so worldremit is gone really really bad and the service is to much bad\n",
      "251. I deleted the app. I’ve never sent money in less than 24 hrs . I always need to talk to them every time…it’s exhaustingAlso the rate of foreign exchange is less than the actual rates so money is lost unnecessarily.\n",
      "252. Pls World remit why don’t you  let someone from Uk make transfer to Nigeria ?Using Wema bank it’s being canceledWhy pls you need to fix this or you don’t accept itPls I need help with these on a sick bed and need that money\n",
      "253. Worse money transfer company. They don't properly show you their charges.\n",
      "254. I am no longer able to use our business credit or debit cards as I have for many years.\n",
      "255. World Remit Transaction number: 405368117  I sent PHP13500 via GCASH, only PHP6000 received by the recipient. Ask customer service, and gave me the run around. It was never resolved. Their customer service agents are basically useless, and will abruptly end the live chat.They basically stole money. Please do not use this site, as they will steal your hard earned money. Better use the Pilipino store to send your hard earned money. This site will steal your money. Beware.Update March 21st: World Remit did reach out, ONLY to be asked to re-send all documents that I have SENT weeks ago, lol. It only means my complain was NOT taken seriously. Again, DO NOT USE THIS APP as they will take your hard earned money.\n",
      "256. Why did world remit stop giving loyalty points and discounts?\n",
      "257. I created a transaction and without explanation WorldRemit cancelled my transaction. While I asked them they don’t give me reasons. Just got reply that I need to change amount, I need to change receipts. They keep saying criteria not match while I asked them what criteria not match so I can fixed it. They didn’t explain.\n",
      "258. Not a good experience. I sent money twice now and had trouble each time whenere the money goes into a black hole and no one knows where it is. Then I get told to call the help line only to find that they are closed.I do not recogment this service.\n",
      "259. Avoid WorldRemit. I have used them many times and they used to be good. Unfortunately their service has deteriorated hugely. My recent experience was farcical. The promised service was not provided and I have spent several weeks trying to get my money back. They have now provided ‘evidence’ that the payment was paid into a different bank from the one I requested. They claim the evidence ‘proves’ the transaction was completed ‘successfully’. Except it actually proves it went to a completely different bank. Of course the money never arrived in the account promised. Customer service has been a succession of calls telling me they have to do more research. No sign they will ever give my money back. Avoid. There are many other more reliable ways to transfer money. NOTE: WorldRemit's response to this review is to urge me to contact WorldRemit. You will know from reading the review that I only wrote this review after weeks of being brushed off by WorldRemit who confirmed for a second time this morning that they unilaterally chose to transfer my money to a completely different bank from the one requested (and paid for) to avoid 'lengthy delays'. They did not tell me they had done that and how is it acceptable to send my money elsewhere without asking me if it's OK to do so (it isn't - I cannot access the funds). So my only edit is to say that the review stands as written with no resolution.\n",
      "260. I was disappointed above the service fees. They usually charged me for 3.99 but for some reason, i have been doing the same process and I was charged for 36.86 dollars\n",
      "261. I am so disappointed in this app it’s been years since Namibia was removed from African country list and I have been contacting the customer service to reinstate Namibia back on the list for 5 years now to no avail\n",
      "262. Only able to send money to Mobile account not to Bank anymore for some reason. Please fix the problem as soon as possible. Otherwise, it’s good.\n",
      "263. Terrible company I contacted them to get my transaction stopped they said will have update in 3 daysThere was no update after 3 days I contacted customer service to make complaint the agent kept on trying to get me off the call.I don't think he even sent my complaint through wouldn't really tell me when I will get update about the complaintIt is very annoying few times I have called today and agent doesn't respond after call has connected I am not sure what the issue is\n",
      "264. They lie yoy by giving referrals offers and you end getting nothing . When call to raise this then the terms are being told to you and you are not eligible for referral gifts which is shame and irresponsible way to do business.  Would never use again and won't recommend to anyone.\n",
      "265. Ive been a loyal  customer with this company for so long but now not anymore due to a scammer that pretending to be one of the world remit agent and victimize me trying to convince me of giving $50 reward coz as they said im refer a friend now ive lost $2,100aud and cant have that money back so world remit do something about this issue that this is not gonna happen to anyone like what happen to me that ive got victimise of a scamm pretending that is a from world remit customer agent. So world remit pls do something to protect customer with this scammers.The scammers use my name as recepient and using the address that i dont know the address and bank account details is name of the bank is Gotyme Bank Corporation that I have no idea .\n",
      "266. I got great help from Aimee from world Remit and all sorted out. My account is active and I can access.Aimee has been a great help. Thanks Aimee.worst customer service ever. pathetic communication. I had my my account deactivated for no reason for a month and I have sent several mails and tried calling but no response at all. there is infinite wait on the phone call which works in the GMT time.tried to look for CEO contact to complaint but there is no details ever.suggest do not get trapped and not use this\n",
      "267. I wish I could give 0 for customer Service, I was in midst of the chat with Liz and I am in stress as is due to urgent need to funds, I had a couple of queries, she literally ended the chat in midst conversation! Very very appalling.I created a transaction due to urgent need of funds overseas. For some technical reason the transaction failed and as I am new to world remit I needed some reassurance from a human being (and not AI). Please bear in mind I am stressed as the need of funds in urgent.I had a few questions and concerns, Liz gave him the same answer as the AI would and ended the conversation while I am typing her another query which she didn't even hear.So frustrating when your are already stressed! Will avoid this as the customer service was very bad.\n",
      "268. Without information they cancel accountsBad service\n",
      "269. Thanks for the great service though Its changed a lot from say a year ago. The contact numbers eg the Australian one does not get picked up at all. i notice recipients do not get the messages anymore for when some cash has been sent to them. The other area of concern is for pick up. Most of the pick up places have got very long ques, wonder how this can be improved.\n",
      "270. The rate for the airtime is to higher Paying £5.50 per $5 airtime it looks like the $ if higher than the pound £.\n",
      "271. Its been 4 days until now my money not yet in to my account, 1st CS said within 24 hours it will credit and they will send email also. Yesterday CS said, just given them 3 hours and will credit to my account, now more than 12 hours until now no email and no money in my account, what happened now? And where’s my money?\n",
      "272. The app is good, the exchange rate is fair, and money transfers are fast. However, their customer support system is terrible. My account has been blocked for a month. I have called at least seven times without a solution. The agents are friendly and try to help, but they seem to have language limitations, and the real issue is with whoever manages emails and account verifications. I sent all the required information to reactivate my account, but I never received a response. Really disappointing\n",
      "273. Transaction was cancelled and when I tried to find out the reason why the chat bot was next to useless and the hold time to talk to a customer agent was around 30 minutes which was costing me an arm and a leg as I was calling from abroad. Can something be done to make it less stressful for your customers to get hold of your customer service?\n",
      "274. Horrible customer service and approval my profile is taking months, so many issues for a confirmation of adress and i cant update my address manually. Everytime i want to sent a documents to the email accounts only i have a reply about \"account is not longer monitoried\n",
      "275. Money was finally received. Even it you don't get what is advertised on the tin \" Fast, flexible and secure money transfers\", how a company resolved their queries and response to the client, is important. This time they fell short.\n",
      "276. My account was deactivated without prior communication with me. To get the account reactivated is now a challenge, even after submitting the requested documents. I was given unfruitful promises that the account will be reactivated in 48 hours, sometimes 24 hours but it’s even way more than 24 hours and nothing seems to have been resolved. This has been happening from 20/02/2025 to 06/03/2025.\n",
      "277. It is easy to use.However it can do better with following- have incentive for loyal members- offer points or discounts to people who send or make transfers monthly- have equal exchange rate same with rhe bank- improve in coming.  There is no one whom you can call or email. Absolutely no communication . World remit is able to give you information but does not have any platform where customers can use to contact them which makes it a one way contact system.And no one likes it.  I us either out of desperation.\n",
      "278. World remit canceled my order in 1 mint and now waiting my money even its 7th day. don't go guys for this below average service.\n",
      "279. It's very demeaning to request the sender's ID when the receiver is collecting the money. If your system cannot verify things like that during the process of creating a transaction, then you shouldn't be in the business of remittances.\n",
      "280. You wrote a letter saying money can be collected in 70 days but you canceled my transaction after 30 days, when my mum desperately needed the money. Could not get the money as soon as it was because she was not well. I was really disappointed and upset by this action.In December I made another transaction which could not go through it took worldremit more than 60 days to refund my money. My cousin made a transaction to Zimbabwe which never went through it’s now two years he has forgotten about getting his money back due to difficulties he has gone through to get his money back.\n",
      "281. Problem:demanding my identification even though I sent my passport many times but you keep on demanding it.In the past this problem accused often!\n",
      "282. I can’t login into my account, I tried calling and it keeps saying enter you number but I have already added the number. Can you please address what your customer care email address\n",
      "283. I could not señd cash to Cambodia- the transfer went to a phone top-up, so I lost US$100\n",
      "284. Money sent to Kenya did not get to the person and when I contacted World Remit I was waiting for 40minutes to get someone to talk to me.\n",
      "285. This time I had trouble doing a transaction tried over 6 times but finally did and money has taken 3days to get to my familyUsually this money is needed urgently in Africa to assist our relatives\n",
      "286. The first card I used was cancelled but the amount was charged twice. No money is yet paid back even if its more than 48 hours since it was wrongly charged\n",
      "287. I have been sending email and messages no one responds and no one fix my problem it’s been 3 week my account not working I have been talking on instagram 3 people every time new one send me messages no one help just wast my time no help I have. I idea here there is not any help link number in Ireland can call and talk not happy with service it’s been 4 week what???\n",
      "288. The rate is too low\n",
      "289. I have used world remit for so many years that I can’t even count it. I love it for it’s fast transactions and ease of use and have never strayed from the service. Sadly, world remit blocked me and deactivated my account for not being able to respond on time to their email requesting documents to verify my account ( this, after so many years of usage). It’s been 10 days since I submitted the required documents and I got absolutely NO reply. Since I am blocked and can’t log in to my account, I can’t access chat and other customer support and the only way to reach them is through calling from 10-12 Mon-Fri…  so just 2 hours to attend to probably thousands of customer phone calls? come on World Remit! This has really caused me a lot of trouble and had no choice but to look for alternative. Currently using their competitor and I’m starting to like it here.\n",
      "290. Most companies try and improve their service.  In recent months WorldRemit have done this:* Removed Web Client* Removed ability to download receipts* Removed ability to be used with company cardsIf you remove the ability to work with you, all we can do is say goodbye.  Goodbye.\n",
      "291. My experience with WorldRemit is excruciating.  Its been weeks since I cancelled a transaction and according to the App the refund was to be credited in my account.  I am still waiting.\n",
      "292. My money was not released in time . I had to call again before the code was sent out to me.\n",
      "293. I tried to download this app on my phone it keeps saying it's not available in my religionPlease I need a solution to this 😕\n",
      "294. WorldRemit authorized a fraudulent transaction in my account, withdrawing money from my debit card without my authorization to send it to a person in Kenya I did not even know. I tried to contact WorldRemit again to ask for a refund since the fraud happened in their systems and they told me that was my problem and would not refund me. There are better, safer apps to send money abroad so do not use WorldRemit because they do not even care about their customers that are being defrauded.Following up on WorldRemit's answer, I wanted to point out the failure of their systems when it comes to protecting customers from fraud. On January 19, 2025, I received a notification on my cell phone indicating that a transaction was initiated in my account to send the equivalent of $500. Since I neither authorized the transaction nor knew this individual, I promptly contacted WorldRemit’s customer service to block the transaction, as it appeared on my phone that the transaction was still processing. However, their representative informed me that it was too late to stop the transaction, but WorldRemit would promptly reach out to its local representative to block the transfer and notify me to confirm. It’s important to note that accessing the WorldRemit app on my phone requires facial authentication and no one else could have approved the transaction, so the fraud occurred within the WorldRemit systems.After not hearing from them for three days, I re-contacted WorldRemit and was instructed that I had to file an official complaint, which I did, to initiate the process. After filing the complaint and receiving a case number, I managed to speak about my case to a representative in WorldRemit’s fraud compliance operations. He informed me that before this fraudulent transaction, there were a few other failed attempts to send money from my account (most likely initiated by the same individual). When I asked why I was not promptly notified of the previously failed attempts so that I could have secured my account, he had no immediate answers but also mentioned that they were still actively investigating the situation and would get back to me with an update on the status of my case. On February 25, 2025, I received an email from WorldRemit, stating that the money was lost and the case was closed.\n",
      "295. I am customer of worldremit more then two years everytime i Send Money in Somalia they cancel it or it Takes Long Time to reach to the Person i send it. Today i was complaining about that issue but the customer Service ignored me and dont react about what i complain it\n",
      "296. The daily limit was too low. Forced to fo 6 transactions\n",
      "297. World remit it’s putting its profits at heart more than the client.  When we send money it’s for emergency purposes but if money is taking more than 5 days how is it emergency then it’s now about making profits with interest forgetting why they even set up this\n",
      "298. You are using western union to send money and taking cut from them also giving us lower exchange rate\n",
      "299. Scam ⚠️. Do bot do transfer with this company. I did two transactions on 18th December 2024 they told me the bank l was sending money ACCESS bank and Fidelity had problem in Nigeria and I would get my refund of $2200. I never got my money. They ended my subscription with them . You will eventually lose your money. I filed a dispute with my bank. And world remit said they have refunded the money my bank .Bank of America wants to know where and who received the money. You have been warned. You may have done transaction successfully in the past. But one day you will be scammed.\n",
      "300. Transactions getting cancelled for all my recivers for last more than 6 months and they are unable to fix the issue yet.Called techinal support as well and they have no clue about it.\n",
      "301. They just removed the ability to use business debit cards -- throws my entire use of the platform to support charity from business out the window. Dumb. And their \"help\" function on the app has been down for a week or so. Used to be really good service, but slipped badly in my opinion.\n",
      "302. Well, due to your apps and ability to respond to the customers on time, my account has been deactivated. It was supposed to be deactivated 24 hours ago. I’m really getting unsatisfied with your service in response I need to be able to use your service and I like using your service so please resurrect my account immediately.\n",
      "303. Worst service I have ever got. Remitly is far better than worldremit. I was used WorldRemit I have made 2 transfer from WorldRemit. When I was made the transfer there was showing my recipients will receive it instantly but it's take about 2 Hours to complete and the worst thing is after 2 days my account has been suspended actually I don't know the reason also they don't tell me the reason why they have suspended my account. Everyone beware of them.\n",
      "304. This app is a scam. Tried sending money to South Africa from Australia..It's said 24hours till the money reaches South Africa.  24hours later, and nothing, person in South Africa confirmed they didn't receive the money.. went on the app to check and chat with the chatbot to see whats going on, and the chat don't work, just kicks me out of the app, then I tried calling the offices to get answers, just get put onto an AI robot that says there is a delay is processing your transaction, no real person to talk too just keeps routing to an AI chatbot that says the same thing over and over again..DO NOT USE THIS APP. YOU WILL JUST GET SCAMMED OUT OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND YOUR FAMILY WILL BE LEFT HIGH AND DRY.\n",
      "305. I have no cell phone, my fingers are too crippled to use, when I was using computer  I thought you were great but now that I need cell phone many times I try some one else. Ed\n",
      "306. This is very frustrating.  They claim they can deliver my money in a few minutes, but it takes up to 4 days. Sorry just is not good enough. And the app is closing when you try to make a complaint and get help. No chance to get through on the phone. They want you to register the transaction number, I've tried that 20 times now and it doesn't work. I strongly advise people to stay away from WorldRemit. There is better providers....\n",
      "307. Not reliable as to use the app Problems with app to return and trying to open the app. by login in.The help desk was nice but cannot help me.They have no clueI used it for a year with no issuesNow it fails.I will have to rely on another supplier like Western Union or Remitly\n",
      "308. Discount codes don’t work. You email discount codes that don’t work when I try to use it.\n",
      "309. Loved how quick the money arrived at my recipient but I needed to change her middle name as I’d spelt it incorrectly!! There is absolutely no way I am allowed to correct it. So very frustrating. Technical issues when you try to change it and you can’t chat online as you’re always very busy!!! 🤷🏼‍♀️\n",
      "310. I like worldremit becoz send quickly but now i dont no what happing\n",
      "311. After several months of using this service, I was investigated (for money laundering I suppose), and this was perfectly OK. In July 2024, I was told to use our business debit card (for a charity), which I did, but it did not work. I noticed that their fees had gone from $3,99 to $14.99. I enquired several times about the business card not working while the 7 times they had charged me $14.99. Eventually, my fees were reprogrammed @ $3.99 but they have never refunded me.Their client support is awful whenever the question require anything more than a very, very easy answer.On March 1, 2025, they advised me they had disabled my account saying that they don't support business or charity operations. On July 18, 2024, they had told me otherwise. Go figure.Update on 2025-03-20: although WorldRemit said they sent me further info following my original post, I have not seen anything.\n",

      "313. Absolute scam. Shows you higher exchange rate on their website and once you press ''send money'' it informs you that their services are available on their app only. When you download the app and register the exchange rate shown is much lower.\n",
      "314. WorldRemit seems to be useless! You call them for a problem, no Agent or customer service to answer you. I change my phone and re-downloaded the app but I couldn't login to my account again, they are sending verification code to a number that's not mine, and I tried changing it but couldn't. Even on their website you can't get any help. I am done with them! so frustrating and unprofessional!\n",
      "315. WorldRemit does no longer inform the recipients, who do only have a mobile phone and not an email account, by mobile phone about the pickup number of the transaction.This makes it unconveniant for me to use WorldRemit\n",
      "316. I haven't used the service in quite a while. And I've changed my phone number. I can't log into the app (all 3 buttons on the login screen do nothing). So I'm stuck, guess I can't use Worldremit anymore. When I call them, they ask for my phone #. And it doesn't recognize my old phone #.Added comment: they just told me to contact them. The only way to do that seems to be by phone. But as i already mentioned above, when I call them, they ask for my (old) phone#. And their computer system then says \"we don't recognize this phone #\". And then communication stops, no way to talk to a human being. Maybe they should have read my review twice and they would have understood that. So for now, I recommend Wyse for money transfers. The \"login\" button on that app allows you to log in.\n",
      "317. WorldRemit provides adequate service when transactions process as expected. However, their system reveals significant flaws when issues arise. Upon attempting to cancel a transfer, I discovered their recovery process is practically nonexistent—my funds became inaccessible with no clear path to resolution. The complete lack of effective dispute channels or responsive customer communication makes this situation particularly frustrating. While WorldRemit may work for straightforward transfers, their inadequate support infrastructure makes them unreliable for anyone who might need assistance beyond basic transactions.\n",
      "318. I have been using this app for a long time but lately it's not allowing me to send money and it's asking authentication to my bank .\n",
      "319. Sending money here was/is like any other platform. Send money with a small pay. Later my account got deactivated and they asked for updated info and I sent them. My account is still deactivated after a few months. I have tried contacting them a few times. Never got any reply, not on my emails and not on the info I uptaded them on.\n",
      "320. Worldremitt.com , It's just a waste of time . Significant delays are in place, do not 🚫 use it.\n",
      "321. I have not been able to process or cancel my transfers to Zimbabwe since Sunday and the app is not allowing me to do anything. Worst experience I've had with these guys. Usually good. How do I contact them?????\n",
      "322. I send money to my sister, can’t take out the transaction. I tried to call with no avail. It’s now two weeks. Can’t fix the problem. World remit do no answer. So hard\n",
      "323. You blocked me from WorldRemit, even though I sent you all the documents I knew. Your problem with me was that I sent too much money to my wife in one month. But even though I wrote to you that I financed our wedding, you haven't even bothered to respond to me for over 3 weeks.\n",
      "324. Hello, I would like to know what is the maximum amount per day ? and how long can I get the money back in my account after i sent the money?\n",
      "325. No help at all my mobile transaction took 33hrs pending to reach my recipient .\n",
      "326. The money I sent to the Philippines in the amoint of P10,158 is not available r pick up , you mención that it is available for pick-up since the other day, so where is the money go, pls. Respond immediately, I ‘d been sending to World remit  more often and this happen for the first time\n",
      "327. My account has been deactivated - because I inadvertently used a wrong email address to login but by the time I realised my mistake, which was understandable given that I rarely am required to 'login' in the App on my phone. Since then, I have been trying to phone so I can rectify the situation. The answering service told me, \"Our services are currently closed, but we are open between the hours...\" HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE I TRIED OVER FIVE TIMES WITHIN THE HOURS SPECIFIED AND STILL GET THE SAME MESSAGE! It says go FAQs on the Website - no related Question (and Answer) there! Go to the In-App Chat, again, my actual query is because I have been locked out of the App! SO WHERE DO I GO? THIS IS EXTREMELY POOR given that I transfer a total of more than $5,000 USD every month!\n",
      "328. Why is it so hard to get customer support through this service. Another disappointing thing compared to other services is when you try to cancel a transfer. It constantly always says when you click on need help and support. The app is not working right now. That's a common scam because they want their share of the percentage when you're sending money. Highly recommend using another service unless they fix this. Me and two friends tried doing the exact same transfer and had the same issue with it. Not wanting to let you cancel your transfer.\n",
      "329. Unable to make Ecocash transactions and experiencing horrible delays . Service sucks\n",
      "330. They sent my money to the wrong person and now they are refusing to this it back. They said it’s not their fault but the fault of the local partners. Meanwhile someone else took my money. I have never been this angry and let down. World remit give me back my money\n",
      "331. Don’t get trapped. they don’t give the promised first time transfer rate for $500 USD to INR. wasted my time creating an account. Horrible customer service.\n",
      "332. Difficult to get in touch with and then get through the Customer Service. In my case, I had to do it 5 times in order for them to freeze and then eliminate my account (due to security breaches, so for serious reasons and you'd think they would act on it the first time I reported it!)They have a tendency to close the chat window within 30 seconds of any of their replies and even though the chat window often doesn't work smoothly allowing you to type fast enough, they don't care, they simply close on you forcing you to contact them again and again, each time talking to a different agent and having to explain everything from the beginning. Frustrating and disappointing!\n",
      "333. My account been deactivated and no email was sent to inform me what to do or need To submit to activate it\n",
      "334. It’s quite lengthy of time to get confirmation that. funds have been sent to designated point!\n",
      "335. Everything but desperation makes me use your swrvice\n",
      "336. It is taking too long to reach the recipient\n",
      "337. My recipient never received the money. I tried several times to contact world remit.They said the money was delivered. They promised to send me a report from the payout location. Never heard back from them. It is impossible to get a hold of anyone on customer service line. You are put on hold for ever, till you give up. If I could give 0 stars I would.\n",
      "338. Can not get a hold of an representative and even the chat bot ends the chat before answering the question. No way to know the status of transaction if you are an receiver.\n",
      "339. Scammers! Tried making a payment that should’ve been quite simple. Transaction has been on hold for a number of hours now. I have tried to raise a support ticket that tells me to check back periodically, however the chat keeps closing , thus putting me further back in this what I believe to be an ‘imaginary’ queue. I have tried calling them up, however my transaction number is ‘not recognised’ and being on hold, the bot says 25 mins queue time and keeps going up to 30 minutes.Avoid at all costs. Total scam\n",
      "340. I tried ro send money since January 7th and was canceled. Never got my money back and never a reply from the tons of emails I sent. Is that fair now?\n",
      "341. I have been on the phone for an hour being told to hold on. This is totally unexceptionable because this is a business.I have not been refunded cancelled transactions from December 24.\n",
      "342. Works fine, but impossible to contact when problems.\n",
      "343. On the whole I have had a wonderful relationship with World Remit..But was just surprised when I wrote the receiver's name wrongly when the money was needed urgently.  World Remit Customer service said names could no longer be corrected over the fone or online. As if that wasn't enuf, they said I have to cancel the transaction but it would take them 5-7 days to process my refund. I was left clutching thin air as that was the only money I had left on me..World Remit must be reminded that some of these recipients are very poor. live in very remote areas and walk long distances to Money collections points..\n",
      "344. I have not received my money since it was transferred from my account to the union bank account in Nigeria so that is bad for business\n",
      "345. Because the system doesn't not working last two month y the is happening to last 10 years using worldremit....\n",
      "346. I have been waiting over 86 hours for the transfer to be completed. Get an email to say its completed but the money still does not reflect in the receiver’s account. Contact customer support and they tell me it will take another 24 to 48 hours! Appalling service!!! Last time I will ever use them\n",
      "347. I’ve had bad experiences with customer service staff - end the convo abruptly, don’t provide information and give have no respect for laws.\n",
      "348. The app is always crashing, and by the time it gets back up and running the exchange rate is less than what i had prio to the crash\n",
      "349. WorldRemit !!!. you deactivated my account!!!Over the past 2 weeks, I talked to your support on the phone asking for help 2 times already,  I replied to your email 2 times already, but until now, you have not reactivated my account. You have not given me any update!What is wrong with you people?????\n",
      "350. After 20hrs on hold the money went throw but next time i will think about it i still think it not okay.\n",
      "351. SCAM SCAM SCAMI sent a transection on 30th of january and the transection has not gone  through  yet today is 26th of february its almost been a MONTH.I contact them every single day And I get different response from every agent I talk to, They stole my money and they know itSTAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM SITEon Friday 28/02/2025 Trustly AB sent my money back and Im thankful for that.\n",
      "352. Inefficient\n",
      "353. I will keep writing and accusing this company of working with illegal organizations to defraud people. They stole my money and do not want to get it back. They are defrauding me and saying we are sorry.\n",
      "354. Poor service , my recipient never get the notification to collect money , in time I had to notify her when she alerted me that she hasn’t received any info from WorldRemit, and this was delayed by 2days yet the money was urgently required\n",
      "355. I needed to transfer approximately AU$900 to Kenya recently and, although your website suggests I should be able to do so in one transaction, I was only able to transfer $200 at a time, which meant I had to pay fees for each transaction.Why was this an issue?\n",
      "356. When my transfer was wrongly doped in the wrong account. With I'm a min. I tried to stop. There was no help on your side when I got to live chat l was told that they can't revise my transfer it will take 2 / 3 months to recover the funds and not shower if it will work. So that way I lost $321.00 very sad\n",
      "357. This time it wasn’t bad, but a transaction in December hit a wall and there was no way to follow up on what was causing the hold. In the I received a “no reply” email indicating I failed to provide documents requested- a total lie. No documents were requested from me, and there was channel for communication on the specifics. I will continue to use WorldRemit if they correct this major deficiency: not having a platform for communication on specific transactions. Your Chat platform is useless.\n",
      "358. I sent 56.000ks to a friend in Kenya to pay for his children's school fees on the 4-2-25. He had not received the money the following day so he went to his local MPesa office who text him - O Customer, a transaction of Sh56,000.00 with TB46REATDS receipts has been returned automatically as the transaction is outdated. Your current account lag is Tsh133.58.  This clarifies that my friend did not receive the money. I have had 5 frustrating phones with Worldremit with each time being told that the transaction had to be verified and an email would be sent to me within the following 24 hours. Needless to say I have never received an email nor has the money been returned and I find the endless circle of lies so disappointing. The children have now been told not to return to school until the fees are paid  -  what can I do???    I have used Worldremit many times but I will never use them again. Again after yesterdays phone call with a promise someone would ring me back - no one has. What a dreadful service\n",
      "359. Sent money to my daughter and it went to another account after almost 48 hours.\n",
      "360. Quality customer and money transfer services have been severely compromised and sending with World Remit is choosing a Hard choice because that is the only one readily available.lts services are now progressed from Good to bad and it's even worse and getting terrible.l once wrote a review and l was phoned asked yo remove it after having a terrible experience.l thought the experiences would get better but some have been regrettably horrible  terrible  nightmares and negative experiences and it's going on and on ..Who knows what's next? It seems as if World Remit is a Plane on Autopilot. With no pilot on board and the flight is at full capacity and they operate their plane on a mobile phone remotely.If things ho wrong and will go wrong requiring human and humane  expertise interventions and resolution,that wouldn't matter to them because they now have a lot of customers as long as people keep on coming even though without reasonable and good customer services what should they worry.Financial services sectors customer services are bad and moving to terrible and appolling.Regretably this is the way it is.My worst night mares !\n",
      "361. Now transaction fee on transaction have to be paid on mobile transfers\n",
      "362. I used to be a satisfied customer of WorldRemit for over a year, and everything worked smoothly—until recently. Out of nowhere, they changed their internal processes and started demanding ridiculous amounts of documentation, even after my account was fully verified.Now, my account is blocked, and I can’t complete transactions without going through this unnecessary hassle. I have provided what ever I could, and request making things for customer easy and not hard.Their customer service is just as disappointing. Instead of offering real solutions, they kept repeating the same demands without explaining why this was suddenly necessary. It feels like they don’t value loyal customers at all.Changing internal processes should NEVER come at the expense of user experience. Forcing customers to jump through hoops after everything was working fine is just bad business.I wouldn’t recommend WorldRemit to anyone until they fix this mess. Plenty of other platforms offer a smoother, more respectful experience without wasting your time.\n",

      "1. A LOUSY SERVICE. after 9 Years of using your service, your company goes out of its way to be a MAJOR LET DOWN POINT IN CASE C18713125 and this is the latest of many casesThe payment is held Up Absolutely no communication's from your company\n",
      "2. Are the servers down? I created an account today and now the app keeps giving me server errors when i try to log in. Can anyone help me please? Overall not a nice first experience.\n",
      "3. Funds were sent the day after making the trade in Euro from my European Bank.  Funds were received by the bank of Xe.com in Frankfurt (Barclays Bank)  the following day.Allowing for weekends the monies in US$ had still not arrived into my US$ bank account even after 11 days had passed and at the time of typing my negative experience here, still have not been deposited.\n",
      "4. I have just closed my account with xe.com. I have used them a lot to transfer money from UK to Croatia but no longer. I tried to transfer €90 from Uk to a friend here in Croatia to pay her for two tickets for a visit and tasting session she had organised  at a local olive oil farm. This transaction was held up by xe.com and they asked me a number of intrusive questions about the relationship with my friend and also wanted an invoice in my name from her in a pdf format! All for €90! Ridiculous! In the end I transferred the money to her by PayPal and closed my account with xe.com. When I discussed this with with xe.com they gave the usual blather about legalities and even mentioned the Bribery Act! Xe.com legal and compliance team needs to show some common sense, otherwise they will continue to lose customers like me.\n",
      "5. Long process to send money internationally (5-6 days)\n",
      "6. It took too long. I had to send two reminders and No response was received. I had to face a number of inconveniences due to unexpected delay. I may not recommend Xe to my friends, family or colleagues. Thanks and cheers.\n",
      "7. I've used XE for years and really have appreciated the ease of the app and a great transfer rate.However, this time when I needed the money quickly in another country, they randomly chose my transaction to get further information, despite that I have always used the same name and bank account details.When they contacted my for more info via email, I didn't respond as I felt that it could have easily been a scam.Now they have cancelled my transaction, but have kept my money, 12 days later I am still trying to get the money to my account overseas.Very disappointed in this ONE transaction, every other time has been very postivie.\n",
      "8. Xe fail to mention that the money you send after there fee is not the amount you recieve at your destination bank.they do not know the path or direction your money takes or the handling fees involved.its only when you realise the money recieved is different that they then say it must be someone in-between that has taken a fee.they know this but fail to mention when you are sending xe your money.when confronted admit they do not know where the money has gone and ask you to trace it back through the bank that recieved. No offer of compensation for money lost or explanation of who took it...\n",
      "9. Took too long to tell me that my payment did not go through. They then asked me some more questions such as person sending, date of birth etc which had already been supplied. When I asked for reason....no response for 4 days. Meanwhile my recipient business very irate. Reputational damage to my business and a delay in a company critical item needed to make revenue. Very poor customer service.\n",
      "10. 9 days after the wire the money didn’t reach the final account… still waiting for it\n",
      "11. Fast, expensive, poor exchange rate\n",
      "12. I have been using XE for the past few years and each previous transfers went smoothly and in most cases I had money in my other overseas account within 24 hours. So having confidence in XE I kept using it for my transfers until the last transfer. I performed my last transfer last Friday.On Monday got an email stating that I need to call the customer service because they could not contact me on my mobile phone. I rang them on Monday to answer some security questions. The operator stated that the answers would be reviewed by the security team. Rang them again on Wednesday still waiting for the transfer to be completed. At the time of writing this, it is already Thursday. I am not sure whether to trust the company any more, having thoughts that it might be is some sort of financial strive - hope not. I still have some faith the the money finały will be exchanged and transfered.\n",
      "13. I have used several other services to transfer money internationally, but Rakuten had an offer to use XE, so I decided to give it a try. I had read the bad reviews on TrustPilot so I tested it with a small transfer. I became skeptical when immediately after creating an account someone called me and offered me a better exchange rate. The site was not very easy to navigate but I managed to put in a small transfer request. I made the request on July 17. On July 18 the money was taken from my account. From July 17-22 the status said \"Action Required\" with no clue as to the action required or who should take action. On July 22 I got an email that said the transfer was complete, but the money did not appear in my bank until July 23. When I use Wise, the transfer completes immediately without issue; they give you the spot price with no spread and just charge a fee.\n",
      "14. SIXTEEN DAYS LATER, and the money STILL hasn't gone through!After many calls to XE customer services, I eventually get an email from someone called Dandelion Payments Care who didn't explain who they are, what the email relates to, a contact name or contact number.This whole experience has been a shambles.I'm still waiting for payment to arrive at the receivers bank - money which is to provide a bright young lady with an education and a future!I am so disappointed. So much so that my only course of action is likely to be a court case.\n",
      "15. My transfer never made it to my destination. It took several days to find out that it did not go through even though I had made the exact same transaction before. It was meant to be money for an anniversary vacation but it got returned to my account after about 2 weeks. What a waste of time. Time to try another method.\n",
      "16. Quite difficult to navigate on the website.Also, the alert are communicating a FX rate and when we go to the the transaction, the FX rate is quite different.Also, delay to get our money is long.\n",
      "17. Yet again an international transfer went awryNever againWill use WU or Regular bank\n",
      "18. After a few days money was returned without explaining why and what was the reason.\n",
      "19. The website was easy to set up the transfer. Rate, fees,times were all all disclosed upfront  exchange rate is very close to the spot rate. You can track the progress of the transfer. However it is not a quick transfer.\n",
      "20. Money is still not transferred\n",
      "21. The Whiteatlasone team was fantastic. They communicated well, worked fast, and ensured I received my full refund without any hassle.\n",
      "22. There were additional’ somewhat irrelevant’ security questions about my employment in the last 10 years and any government roles.  I have been retired for over 10 years.  Then there was no feedback for several days.  I had to call the helpline to instigate some follow up.  I then had to reload a full investment document when i had already provided the key front page.  As a result the recipient was late receiving the payment.  I had sent 4 previous USD remittances through HiFX/XE previously.\n",
      "23. I sent $A405 to you on 12/7/25 re C1865-838 but for some unspecified reason that was rejected and returned to my Bank. After phoning your helpline on 14/7/25 I sent you $A 405 once more and was assured that a net would be placed on your records. However I have not hard anything further and nothing has been returned to my Bank account.In m past transfers via you everything has been dealt with on the same day so I hope that this is an exception\n",
      "24. very slow and the then they ask to give them a review before the transfer was complete\n",
      "25. July 11, Friday I look at and in progress it showed Action Required. I never received any E-Mail to tell me what went wrong. There is no one available on phone on weekends. Monday the money was transferred. I still do not understand what action was required. I called Monday 877-932-6640 and keep on waiting for 20 minutes and nobody pick up the phone. Very disgusting. It happened first time and why?\n",
      "26. Whilst my French bank, who aren’t quick in their best days,  were unexpectedly slow, and I suspect deliberately so, the reactions from XE to communication were good enough, until the final communication, at which point they dropped the ball, or more accurately, just didn’t look where the ball was.Better than most corporations though these days,\n",
      "27. My transfer of USD5.494,51 to the UAE was carried out correctly, well received by the beneficiary however a couple of days later I received an email that the money was returned to XE and transferred back to my bank account. After investigating the matter XE claims that they sent me an email requiring information about purpose of payment, source of payment, how the funds accumulated etc. an email which I did not receive and to which -obviously- no reply was sent. Instead of double-checking with me and send a request reply, XE initiated the return of the funds without further asking and putting me in a very dire position in relation to the beneficiary. All this resulted in unnecessary bank charges of USD75,00 to me. I have now resend the monies due to the beneficiary via WISE platform at an even better rate than XE.\n",
      "28. This is the second time I've tried to use XE and its failed, not just failed, but support told me its gone and will be with the recipient any day now. After 14 days of waiting, its been returned. Seriously poor service\n",
      "29. First time using Xe transfer.Recipient received the money 7 days from transfer.  When I chose xe it was because it stated Recipient would receive the funds within 10 minutes.Urgently needed to transfer the money for family member overseas to get Urgent surgery.Once burnt never again Xe.Your customer service is pathetic,  your fees are the highest compared to remitly and western union. And your transfer times advertised are blantly false advertising.Never ever again will I use XE.Beware people!!\n",
      "30. Took over a week to make transfer. The money was taken out of my bank on 1st and didn't recieve it in my other bank until the 9th. IF everything is digital and computers work 24/7/365 why do you have programed days off. My pension payments are all handled by computer no people(who don't work weekends and holidays) every fourth wednesday it is in my bank.\n",
      "31. Transaction didn’t go through to the recipient’s account and XE did not even returned the full money. They created a transfer back due to which I lost a lot of money. Calling XE customer care was not helpful. Never using this trash service. Would’ve given 0 stars if that was an option. I have transferred several thousands of dollars through XE in the past but this is how they treat their customers. Goodbye XE!\n",
      "32. I have been with Xe for a number of years now and, am well familiar with the process to exchange and transfer funds abroad.  The process is relatively easy and efficient.  My only concern is the exchange rate which is not competitive.\n",
      "33. slow , and never received the opening account  $30 bonus\n",
      "34. I initiated a transaction on 24th June, and the payout page stated the transfer would typically be completed in a few minutes. However, I was later informed that it could actually take 1 to 3 business days.After waiting the full 3 business days, I contacted support for an update and was asked to provide additional information, which I promptly submitted. I was then told to wait another 1 to 3 business days for processing.On the following Monday, I was again asked for more details. When I sought clarification on what exactly was required (as the instructions were unclear), I was told that XE had contacted their partner and I should wait for a response via email. At that point, I realized this could easily take another 1 to 4 business days, so I decided to request a refund on 7th July.I was told they had initiated a callback to the recipient bank (some partner bank actually) and were waiting for a response, with a follow-up date set for 14th July. On 14th July, I was simply informed that they still hadn't received a response and were waiting again — this time until 21st July for the next follow-up (extremely disappointed). It seems clearly delaying tactics, holding payment for so long period!IMPORTANT:The money never reached the recipient bank. It is currently held by XE's partner bank.I was given three different reference IDs, and the recipient bank confirmed that none of them match any transaction in their system.This situation is both frustrating and unacceptable. I understand that international transfers may occasionally take time, but1. Being constantly misled on timelines2. Having to wait 7 days between every follow-up, as it is a stoneage era :)As of now, my funds are stuck with their partner bank, and XE has provided no concrete resolution. I am planning to consult with a lawyer this Thursday to explore options for recovering my money and seeking compensation for the misguidance, miscommunication, and emotional distress caused by this ordeal.I will never use XE again and strongly advise others to stay away from their services.DO NOT USE XE. I repeat, DO NOT USE XE.\n",
      "35. Web not user friendly. Too many canned responses. Took too long to advise me nò transfers to Intercam banco. Cancelled my membership,requested appeal which I submitted. Have not heard back. Refund of my $1000 was done quickly thank you.\n",
      "36. Please read my emails\n",
      "37. Kinda funny how I only get requests for reviews when the transfer goes through quickly, whenever the transfer process has been woefully slow I never get asked to do a review.The transfer rates are OK although the rates seemed better when it was Hifx.\n",
      "38. I transferred funds directly from my BMO account to their BMO account a few minutes after I initiated my trade.  My XE account number was used as the reference number yet they could not find my funds which delayed the transfer.  The funds were not delayed by the bank as suggested by XE.\n",
      "39. It took too long.Wise.com sends the funds immediately\n",
      "40. I initiated the contract on Tue, money was transferred and confirmed on Wed. Final transaction to the client did not occur until Fri. Normally this will happen on the same day instantly. I was very disappointed that you held onto the funds for 48 hours without completing the transaction.\n",
      "41. No friendly use, they are not following GPDR, requesting to receive unprotected email for bank verification\n",
      "42. Too long to receive money.\n",
      "43. Horrible experience, every time i call customer service for help, i got no help but disappointment.\n",
      "44. I wanted to transfer Australian dollars to Euros. I was prompted to set up my account and verify my identity which was relatively straightforward. However, once sign up was complete and my transfer confirmed I was sent a UK bank account number to pay my funds into. I contacted customer support and was told XE does not have a local account in which to deposit funds. What then is the point of XE? International transfers cost a fortune and I would have needed to make one in order to use XE. For a so-called international money transfer service this is a joke. This should be made clear as soon as a transfer in AUD is commenced. I wasted my time and unnecessarily entrusted my identify documents to a company which is clearly incompetent.\n",
      "45. This service is useless for currencies other than GBP, EUR and USD. They have great conversion rates from these currencies to all others in the world.They only hold these 3 accounts, so you can't transfer in other currencies. So yes, they state to have the best currency rates, but no, they can not give them. I'm a UAE account holder and they can't receive AEDs, so be aware of the transparency.\n",
      "46. Long time for fund transfer. Xoom provides the funds in minutes!\n",
      "47. It takes beneficiary a week to receive the funds.\n"
