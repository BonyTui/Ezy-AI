They can deliver to further cities on the next day.In summary,  use Ezyremit if you have one week to 2 weeks to receive the money in Việt Nam. This is the fact.",

It’s not just my account—my partner’s and a friend’s accounts have also been suspended, seemingly without proper cause or consistent reasoning. That alone raises serious concerns about how Remitly handles user accounts.Secondly, they made me do a 30-minute interview explaining each of my expenses before suspending the account. And all of my expenses were  legal, legitimate, and for personal or family use. It felt excessive and invasive, especially considering there was no indication I had violated any terms.The final and most troubling issue is that once an account is suspended, you lose access to your past transaction history. In my case, I needed the recipient information from a large payment I made—specifically for a vehicle purchase—but Remitly won’t allow me to log in to retrieve that data. Their email receipts don’t include full details, which effectively locks me out of important financial records I should have access to.I would not recommend Remitly to anyone due to the lack of transparency and poor customer service.",

This makes it worthwhile only for larger transfers, but not ideal for people sending small amounts, as the fee stays the same.Another issue is the transfer time—it can be slightly longer than expected. So, if someone is looking for an instant transfer, they might be disappointed.Overall, it’s a decent service for larger transactions, but not the best choice for quick or low-value transfers.",

For example, sending money to Somalia can take up to 4 days—that’s not acceptable in 2025, especially when other companies can deliver in minutes.If you improve your transfer speed, especially for urgent situations, I believe you could gain millions of customers who currently use those faster services.

I resorted to Remitely as it was the only choice I had at that moment: my account was instantly suspended without proper reason. The already stressy day become much worse as I needed their service --thinking it was reliable.I went to their website and started a chat-session.

Unfortunately, it has been over four days, and the money still has not been delivered to the recipient.Even worse, Remitly has already taken money, from my bank and now I’m left with no service, and no support. I’ve contacted their customer service several times, but no one is willing to explain what’s going on. It feels like I’ve been completely ignored.I did not receive what I paid for, and this delay has caused embarrassment. This level of service is absolutely unacceptable for a financial company handling people’s money.If you’re considering using this company to transfer funds, think twice – once they have your money, you’re on your own.",

        "text": "They Took over $270 sent, it shows delivered but was never ever in my bank, went to my bank and they showed me that it never delivered, called remitly and they confirmed it was sent, later they lied it's a wrong account number, and guess what I used the same account number to receive another transaction from them and it came through. It's been over 3 weeks and I still haven't seen my money. Today they took another $20. It's ridiculous that remitly will allow their staff steal from their clients,, because I strongly suspect there's someone within remitly stealing from their clients. I already knew remitly will typically ask me to go to their support but guess what it; it's typically same answer and same taking clients for granted when you clearly know it's a challenge from your end. I'll go to the remitly Whatsapp channel and Chat with and come back here to paste the exact replies and outcome.",

They closed both accounts, and held on to my money and kept mute! Return my money or send it, No. Meanwhile, the receiver is facing serious, life threatening issues.

        "text": "I have used this service at least 10 times over 2yrs since changing from Western Union. It has been good except for my last 2 transactions. This review is specifically for people sending money to Samoa.Be aware that whilst it is convenient to send money via a mobile app I have encountered a couple of issues.1) The exchange rate, I noticed, was 10cents less that sending via Pacific Ezy. Yes you have to go in store, but if you sending a large amount of money, you can get extra for  the aiga. This will be up to remitly to compete with other agencies. However, despite Remitly having low processing fees (compared to $10 per transaction at Pacific Ezy) Remitly recoup more profit by providing a poor exchange rate.2) Using remitly, on my transaction 2/7/25, the transfer was delayed. Be careful if aiga in Samoa need urgent cash. There were multiple online excuses (via their online chatbot) including the Network in Samoa was down, the receiving bank was undergoing maintenance thus delaying the processing of the transaction or the service providing the cash payout in Samoa was low on funds??? It took 24hrs for the funds to arrive. I had to call Remitly to chase my cash and they advised me to provide the bank account of the the receiver and they would credit the funds there. Now they told me it would take a further 24hrs to reach the account. However, this was not the case, from sending from NZ to Samoa took 24hrs and 3 phone calls to remitly. Please be mindful that there are times when a rapid transfer nay not occur. The reasons are vague.3) On 12/7/25 I wanted to send money to Samoa. I do send money to family a lot. Now whanau please be aware and check the transaction details BEFORE submitting for processing. As I was about to tempt fate...lol and submit to send the transaction. It came up with a window that I had to confirm, which states that the transaction will take 3 to 4 days, giving the same excuses as the above previous transaction.Please be aware that Remitly does work most times, but there is something weird happening with the service to Samoa at this time. If money needs sending urgently, I would use another method.P.S. I do not work for Pacific Ezy or Western Union",

        "text": "I started using Remitly two months ago.  I send small amounts every week via mobile transmission to support family and friends.  There have been no problems until I decided to send a large amount to be deposited into a bank account. They advertise that the account should be credited in three to five days.  So, after three days, I could see in their system that there was a delay they were working on.  I rang to find out about the delay and how long it would take to resolve.  All all three occasions, the answer was the same and vague: \"we are working on it\".  I rang on 8th July 2025 and they said the money had been successfully transmitted.  This was also reflected in their app. They promised the money should be credited into my account within three days, depending on the receiving bank.  14th July 2025, the the receiving bank had not received the money.  They asked for the name of the correspondent bank and the reference number so that they could track it. I chased Remitly and they said they had done their part, and the receiver's account had been credited.   They said they could not give me the name of the transmitting bank because it was secret.  The same day, 14th July 2025 I received an email from Remitly saying that they had not sent the money.  They wanted to see my bank statement before sending the money.  I instantly sent them the bank statement and followed with a phone call to find out why they needed to see my bank statement and how long it would take to transfer the money which they had earlier claimed that they had already transmitted.  The person on the phone said that the email was not from Remitly. This was confusing.  I again asked to be given their correspondent bank money transmission reference, which again they insisted they cannot because it was secret.  They sent me some funny reference number without revealing the transmitting bank.  The receiving bank has told me the reference number they have given doesn't tell anything in the banking system.  Right now, I do not know where my money is, and why they handle transactions like Crypto platforms, where everything is opaque.  Are they trading with the money? And why do they keep lying to me? To prove that I am genuine, their reference number is R21965835367",

I had previously sent money to the same receiver on 24/12/2024 (MTCN 040-269-3131) where both my passport and the receiver’s ID card were uploaded and verified in their system.Despite this, the recent transaction was stopped for a “compliance check” and I was told it would take 48 hours. When I called on 27/07/2025, the compliance representative was unhelpful and when I asked for a supervisor, I was kept on hold for over 15 minutes. The supervisor eventually came on the line but said they couldn’t help as the department holding my transaction was a different team and only promised to “email them” to call me.I explained clearly that all required ID documents are already stored in their system from the previous transfer, yet they still blocked the payment. I also requested a refund and was told it cannot be cancelled.This is completely unacceptable customer service. It appears that Western Union unfairly flags transactions to people with Islamic names like Mehmet under the excuse of “compliance checks.” I have been left without my goods and without my money.I will never use Western Union again and do not recommend them to anyone.",

Il destinatario non ha mai ricevuto i soldi, anche se la transazione risulta \"completata\".Da allora ho contattato il servizio clienti decine di volte: via telefono, email e modulo di reclamo. Ogni volta ricevo risposte automatiche, link generici o promesse di aggiornamenti che non arrivano mai.Sono passati più di 3 settimane e nessuno ha fornito una risposta concreta o una soluzione. Ho seguito tutte le procedure indicate, ma senza risultato.Trovo inaccettabile che un'azienda come Western Union ignori i reclami di questo tipo, soprattutto trattandosi di somme importanti e di un servizio che dovrebbe garantire sicurezza nelle transazioni.Chiedo che il mio caso venga finalmente preso in carico da una persona reale e risolto immediatamente.On June 4th, 2025, I made a transaction through Western Union for €600. The recipient never received the money, even though the transaction shows as “completed.”Since then, I have contacted customer service dozens of times: by phone, email, and through the official complaint form. Every time, I receive automatic replies, generic links, or promises of updates that never arrive.It has now been over 3 weeks, and I still haven’t received a clear or concrete answer. I followed every procedure requested, but nothing has been resolved.I find it unacceptable that a company like Western Union can ignore serious issues like this, especially when it involves such a large amount of money and a service that should guarantee security in transactions.I ask that my case be urgently handled by a real person and resolved immediately.",

Western Union should either flag the system to reflect this lack of participation for the senders or remove the foreign businesses as working locations.Money Gram works instead for anyone sending to this location and the fees were far less.",

My son needs money maybe twice a month that I send to him.  I’m 300 miles away.     After an hour —- no transfer.   I call.  A India man with thick accent answers and asks me WHY I’m sending money.   The reason why. To whom.   What’s he going to do with it      He approves or not.   And I’ve been denied last couple times for telling him my son gets the money because I help him financially while he’s in school.     He denied me.I learned that CHIME and VENMO and MONEYGRAM are much better and cheaper than western union and their boneheads.     Usually send to chime to chime ( free).  When I have money on Venmo he can withdraw that for free to his chime acct by linking my Venmo to his chimeOne good thing the India boneheads taught me was to find other ways to transfer money and truly western union is OBSOLETE!!      If you absolutely have to do a transfer like this —- check into MONEYGRAM at Walmart.      Very fast.  Immediate transfer and much cheaper  !!!",

On July 3rd, I was told via email that the money was available for payout – which turned out to be false.On July 7th, after chasing their customer support multiple times, I was informed the transaction was canceled and a refund would be sent within 5–7 business days. Today is July 23rd, and I still haven’t received anything. After more follow-up, I was told the money was never sent – despite earlier claims it was processed on July 11th.This is outrageous: false information, no accountability, no follow-up, and complete lack of transparency. I’ve wasted time, energy, and trust in this company. I demand immediate refund, an explanation, and compensation for the trouble caused.Absolutely unacceptable service.",

I was told that they would not do the transfer due to the belief it is a fraud scheme, which it isn't. Despite my insistence on completing the transaction, I was denied, and my money (hopefully) will be refunded to my account. Due to this, I may lose the lease on the home and will not have a place to stay. I am beyond disappointed in your service, and will not use this again.",

None of the agents can give a reason as to why it is taking so long to transfer and there is so much static on the line, you cannot hear half of what they say.  W.U. uses in intermediary bank. These banks hold fund and trade the money overnight to make more money.  Ok, I'll give you the 0-4 business days, but six days is just being greedy.  Can you guess what money transfer service I will not be using ever again Corporate greed is so out of hand.  Its profit over people and that is all companies care about.",

I messaged Western from May 2025 but up to this day, July 2025 nothing happened. I already showed the screenshot of the problem, I gave the first four digits of my number as well as the last digits, some of security questions. BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. Too much customer service support email me but again, nothing change. Please, I am begging to Western for a long time regarding this issue. My family needs me.

        "text": "I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with how Western Union has handled my transfer. What I experienced feels like negligence and possible fraud.On June 30, 2025, I went to receive a money transfer from my brother. I visited multiple Western Union agents across Mississauga, and most told me they didn’t have enough cash or only send transfers. One Walmart location at 800 Matheson Blvd W took all my information and said they could only deposit the funds directly into my bank account using my debit card. They tried over five times, and the transaction kept failing. I never received the money, yet the transfer was marked as “paid.”I called Western Union on July 2nd to report the issue and followed up again on July 8th. I was told it would take 22 business days for an investigation — which is unacceptable, especially since no one has contacted me or my brother, and no one has even gone to Walmart to check the security video.When I asked the customer service agent what they would do about Walmart refusing to give me cash and marking the transaction as completed, she simply said, “we are waiting for Walmart to respond,” and gave me no answers about what action would be taken.This delay has caused me to fall behind on bills, created emotional stress, and taken up my time for something that should have been simple. I was supposed to receive the money in cash, not be forced to use a debit deposit that failed repeatedly. This is not acceptable.Western Union has shown a complete lack of urgency, responsibility, and customer care. I would never recommend using their services again.",

That is the fee I am charged up front. However we are charged another fee by the receiving Western Office. Example if the exchange rate is 56.00 peso to one U.S. dollar the Philippine Western Union only pays 54.00 peso per one U.S. Dollar. Keeping two pesos per U.S Dollar for the transaction. Thus we pay the 4.99 or 6.99 sending fee and if I send 100 U.S. Dollars the receiving Western Union is keeping (charging) fifty peso for giving my receiver the funds I am sending.",

This is not the first time that it happened with Western Union.  I send money to my family in Pakistan every month and I have had no problem with REMITLY.  Today, after many months, I decided to use Western Union as the rates were a little bit better but wasted nearly 2 hours of my time.  Now I have to wait \"up to 7 days\" to get my money back. Terrible service.  At least they should give you a reason as to why your transaction was cancelled and why did they not try again. Or there should be an instant refund so we can use other methods to send money.  What if someone was desperate for those funds on the other side of the world?",

However, the system still showed the delivery date as the same day the transaction was initiated. There was no clear or adequate explanation provided regarding the so-called technical issue.Customer service was particularly disappointing. The representatives came across as entitled and unhelpful, repeating scripted responses without addressing my actual concerns—one even disconnected the call abruptly. As for email support, they failed to respond altogether.It is deeply frustrating and disheartening that an international company would provide such poor service. The experience left me feeling as though I was dealing with a scam rather than a reputable financial institution.",

        "text": "I have been trying to send money to my wife who was unable to exchange our local currency at the airports when she flew.  So she arrived in a country that she has never been before with very little local currency to get by.  Luckily, she already has a place to stay where they provide her with food.Giving our money to Western Union was easy.  The online payment system, choosing all the options of who you want to send the money to, where, and how ... is all smooth.  So they get their money quickly.However, when my wife tried to pick up cash from the agent that we found on Western Union's website telling us that my wife needed to go there with her government issued ID and the tracking number to fill out a form and collect cash, the agent (at Wal Mart) was incredibly unkind to her and refused to give her the cash that Western Union was so happy to take from us.The cashier only said that she could deposit it into a bank account if my wife provided her with a debit card ... back to where the money was coming from!!!  What use is that?If I could give Western Union a 0-star review I would, because what is the point in having a company that helps you to send money around the world if they don't let you collect it at the location where they told you to collect it from when you have done everything that they told you to do??",

        "text": "I am very disappointed with western union money transfer. I must also say this is my second one in the last 5 years, but when it comes to money, I think there must not be even one such experience.So on this occasion I made a small fund transfer to a bank account internationally on the 3rd of July for an elderly person. WUMT promises customers that the money will arrive the recipient’s account in maximum of 1-2 working days. Third day I contacted WUMT as the money is held at their branch and they have asked recipient to go to their branch in person to collect the cash, despite the transaction was to a international bank account.The customer service agent on the telephone conversation promised me on the 5th that, they have raised a complaint as there seem some technical issues in WUMT and that caused this issue where my money is held by them in their branch to be collected in person. I was also promised their complaints team will contact me in 24 hours.The best thing is that 1) their technical issues has not seemed to have resolved until now, whilst I am writing this review and MY MONEY IS WITH THEM, also they have charged me extra for this transfer. 2) the complaints team haven’t bothered to contact me even after 29 hours.So the conclusion is - I made my very last transaction with WUMT on the 3rd of this month. Having said that I want my money back, including the fees I paid ASAP with compensation for all the inconveniences caused and I will never ever recommend WUMT to anyone in future regardless of any benefits they will have to offer.Other customers please be aware of such potential issues that you could face in the future.Thank you",

They first said please check your bank it is being delayed in my bank, RBC Royal Bank of Canada does not delay. Despite that I went to the bank, they said money has already been deducted gone... Now I am in phone with one customer agent, he says let me check... and gone for a few minutes. I am wondering how many people experience such negligence and delays. Now the Western Union has money for a few days... it is sitting on it. How many millions of dollars do they keep for days without interest? It is a really absurd. Sujata",

I did all what they wanted and the transaction continued to be on hold. If you complain they will claim that your name is matching someone who is suspicious even though they have all the documents and they already did the verification so many times. They act as if they are the only transfer service in the market while there are many alternatives. It is just false advertising that the transaction will arrive imidiatly. This explains why western union is losing its market shares. Even investors are getting rid of the stock due to the unresponsable treatment of the customers. It will never be reliable service when you have to go through the verification every time you use the service. My conclusion that western union intend to hold your money for the longest period with the exercise of verification even if you are already verified.",

        "text": "Truly! Western Union is the worse company anyone can use to send money. Just read about my experience:I went on their website to send $100.00 to a friend in the Dominican Republic. Despite I have an account with them for about 20 years, after providing me with the tracking number and charging my bank they place the transaction pending. My friend in DR had to turn back home because of course they said the transaction was pending. I contacted them and they told me I need it to send an USA I to prove I was a legit customer and not an scammer. After expressing my frustration I had no choice, either I do it or leave the $100.00 in their bank. They sent me a link to upload both sides of my driver license. It took about 40 minutes due to the malfunction of their system.  After I was able to upload my information they sent me an email telling me \"Your money transfer is available for payout (Tracking Number xxxxx) Is not guaranteed that this will be a walk in the park because at one point I went through the process of retiring some non paid money and I had to go to different western union locations and call customer service many time before I was paid.You would think that instead of creating me the other inconvenience of having to go into a line and an claim my money that instead they would had issue a credit through my credit card? No they did not care for my time at all.To conclude: They don't care if you waste your time, and they won't make it any easy to refund your money, I feel so agrivated and will delete my account and will ever again use Western Union to send money. I would rather send my money with a pigeon instead.The question is can anyone put a price to the aggravation. Not worth it. To concludes I should say Western Union really sucks.",

WHY? The same stupid questions every time. How many times do you need to answer the same stupid question? And the other thing is if you try complaining about something to customer services, well that's like talking to a brick wall, they have no, completely no comprehension of English and English sentences.  like talking to a brick wall and you get nowhere with your complaint, they don't understand your complaint never mind even trying to resolve it. customer services are worse than rubbish.",

Their country is a nightmare, so I like to send them a gift or help with medical issues once in a while, and Moneygram flagged my transaction ($500) and shut down my profile.  I called their service number, the girl who answered was very hard to understand, said I was shut down and that I could do nothing to reopen.  I asked for her supervisor.

I phoned Moneygram and they said they had blocked payment since they were concerned about fraud. I received no communication that the payment was blocked. Consequently with the delay I lost my room at the Hotel. Why was I not informed? Why the block when this would have been the third payment to the same recipient. When I complained I was put through to someone with poor English skills who was simply unable to grasp or understand my experience. Would not recommend.See below the “copy and paste” response.

Proper identification and reference code was given yet money gram people in Kinshasa will put in a code stating something was wrong with the person’s ID or something. The problem is money gram have no control over their personnel internationally.The Standard Operating Procedure is not strictly followed and when customer service is called their justification is nonsensical. The customer service don’t check back in their data base to see if you have been sending money to the same person etc. They collect information but they can’t give any justification why they want the information. While my ordinary telephone company could collect the data, justify, verify and make a judgement with one customer service agent on the same day not several days later after using multiple departments.This is coming from someone who has been with Money gram for the past 25 years. I have reached my last straw with them. Their international section needs more training and to stop trying to intimidate customers for a portion of their money.",

        "text": "I have been a routine customer of MoneyGram International for the past +3 years, sending money routinely to my girlfriend in the Philippines using MoneyGram's mobile app. Out of the blue on 5/27/25, my attempted money transfer of $300 was held up pending more information needed to be provided. So, I contacted MoneyGram by phone and spoke with a customer service rep. The rep informed me that they would need to ask me additional questions about my transaction before they could allow it to be sent. I was totally okay answering questions, as I had nothing to hide. I was asked many questions about how long I'd known my girlfriend, how we met, how often we communicate, when did we meet, and what was the reason I was sending \"my\" money, amongst a few other rather personal questions. I felt like I was being interrogated by the FBI or something. But fine, I understand the world in which we live and how bad online scams are. Afterall, I spent many years investigating these very types of crimes. So, I gave the company the benefit of the doubt that they were just doing what they needed to do, to make sure neither I nor my girlfriend were scammers. Long story short, I answered all of the questions honestly and had no concerns because I knew I was not engaging in anything unlawful. MoneyGram canceled my attempted transfer and fully refunded my money 24 hours later (thankfully). I attempted to log back into my account today so that I could try again, only to find out that they closed my online account, and gave me zero reasoning why until I called in to find out why I could no longer access my online account. I was told that they \"were not comfortable with my activity, and that they could not verify my identity online\". I'm not sure why they couldn't verify my identity, as they certainly had my identification information from my account. But anyways, they just lost a 100% legitimate routine customer for over +3 years, because I somehow made them feel uncomfortable because I was using their online service to send money overseas to my girlfriend. The same person I have been routinely sending money to for +3 years without any issues, and no complaints. Just amazing MoneyGram. Job not well done. I'm guessing that the scammers get better service now than your once otherwise regular law abiding customers do. Smdh. Will gladly seek out your top competitors to continue doing my routine \"legal\" business, while you continue serving or servicing your scammers. Thankfully there are alternatives for the services you offer, and hopefully you will soon go the way of the dinosaurs, with your new found ridiculous hyper suspiciousness. And for the record, the first search I conducted after writing this review, was to find out who your top competitors are. Here I come Wise and Remitly, you can thank MoneyGram for sending me your way.",

He went to the bank to collect the money, but the cashier was unable to process the cash out and couldn’t provide a clear reason why. Shortly after, the transaction was automatically cancelled without any explanation.When I contacted MoneyGram for help, their customer support was unhelpful and vague. I was told the transaction was cancelled because the receiver was “deemed unusual,” which makes no sense. I’ve been sending money to my father for over 15 years without a single issue using other services. This was my first time using MoneyGram and definitely the last.I even asked if they could simply change the receiver’s name so that someone else in my family could collect the funds, but they refused. Now I have to wait 10 business days to get my money back, while my family, who needed the funds urgently, is left waiting.People send money for important reasons, often to support loved ones in need. It’s incredibly frustrating when companies like MoneyGram treat such situations with carelessness. I strongly advise others to avoid using MoneyGram and choose a more reliable service.",

I used to call them if I had an issue, now it is almost impossible to talk to a human. It is a bad robot that keeps repeating scripted answers which is time wasting and frustrating.

        "text": "Review Title: Bad Experience with MoneyGram – Delay and Non-Refund of Transfer FeesDetails:I sent £330 to Saudi Arabia via MoneyGram on February 21, along with an additional transfer fee of £4.99. Unfortunately, when the recipient went to collect the amount in the city of Sabya, none of the banks could process the transfer. He went to the National Commercial Bank, Al-Rajhi Bank, Arab Bank, and several other banks I don’t remember the names of, but all of them refused to give him the amount. Each bank asked him to go to the city of Jizan or another city to collect it, which put him in a difficult position.What was frustrating is that some banks told him that if the transfer had been sent via Western Union, they would have given him the money immediately, but because it was a MoneyGram transfer, they couldn’t process it! I had used MoneyGram in the past to send transfers to Yemen and had no problems with either the transfer or receiving the funds; on the contrary, the service was good. I even wrote a positive review about my previous experience. But unfortunately, this new issue has upset me greatly, and I didn’t expect such poor service from MoneyGram.When I contacted customer service, they confirmed that the recipient couldn’t collect the amount from his location and offered no solution except to cancel the transfer and refund the amount. But the bigger issue is that MoneyGram refused to refund the transfer fee (£4.99), even though the mistake was on their part, as they didn’t clearly specify the branch locations where the transfer could be collected before completing the transaction.Additionally, it will take 10 days to get the amount refunded to my account, which is a long and unjustified time. As if that wasn’t enough, I had to take an advance in order to send the amount to the person I had transferred it to, making the situation even more difficult. This has been a completely unsatisfactory experience, and I urge users to thoroughly check whether the transfer can be collected before using MoneyGram, as they may find themselves in a similar situation with no proper compensation, even if the mistake was on the company’s side.",

        "text": "MoneyGram has eroded into one of the sleaziest most dishonest transfer services in the world. You have a very good chance of never seeing your money again if you foolishly trust these horrible people. I recently had a terrible experience with MG and I contacted my friend who works with a group who investigates reports of companies and services who are getting numerous complaints. They agreed to investigate MoneyGram and the results were shocking. In the last year the majority of the 5 star reviews are completely FAKE. We know this because we used the Fakespot Review Checker by Mozilla to check and grade all the reviews in the last 12 months. The FRC is highly accurate and uses a high-tech scientific method to check and grade reviews for authenticity. TrustPilot claims to use a similar system but either that software is not as accurate or they simply have too many reviews to scan them all and that's understandable. After scanning all MoneyGram 5 star reviews the FRC gave a true grade of less than 2 stars overall which is a D grade of the A to F scale the FRC uses. This is a very poor rating that proves the majority of 5 star reviews being submitted over 12 months are not from actual customers but planted by MoneyGram to give prospective users a false perception of the deceitful and dishonest way they've been ripping people off. To get the true and actual results from using the MoneyGram service read the 1 & 2 star reviews of which there are thousands. You'll see one nightmare after another of how everyone lost all their money putting their trust in Moneygram. They've become so corrupt and dishonest that the Post Office and all other substantial MG locations in London have completely canceled their contract with MG and refuse to honor their payouts. The same thing is taking place in Australia. My own experience is even more solid proof of just how corrupt this service has become. Last Christmas I used MG for the 1st time to send a small transfer under $50 to my wife in the Philippines from California. I saw they offered a free debit card you could load money onto and use it as a normal bank debit card. So I signed up easily with no ID required and loaded a small amount to test it. I sent my wife half the money on the card and it went through. I left the rest to use as a quick emergency transfer in case my wife suddenly needed cash. Last week her apartment was broken into when she was visiting her mother and among other things taken the thieves cleaned out all of her food which isn't surprising in the Philippines. So she had no food and almost no money. But when I tried to send her the $18 I'd left on the debit card I got a message saying I needed to show a picture ID to complete the transaction. But my state ID expired in January and I couldn't renew because I was deathly ill with the flu, or possibly covid. So I tried using Western Union but MG wouldn't allow me to use the debit card either to send the $18. I called customer service and complained saying \"What kind of scam is this? You didn't ask for ID to deposit the money but now you demand ID to get it back!\". The agent sounded like a robot....\"Our policy requires an ID to continue using the service\". I said \"I don't want to use the service....just give me my money back!\". \"Our policy requires......\". I demanded a supervisor 4 times and he kept lying saying he was the only one I could talk to. He finally gave in and connected me to a supervisor who must've magically appeared somehow. But she was nothing but the female version of him and kept repeating the same thing over & over again \"Our policy.....\". I told her \"You take money with no ID but then you won't give it back without ID....that's just stealing. You actually think that's being fair?\". \"Our policy requires....\". It was unbelievable. The company is completely corrupt and doesn't give a flying you-know-what about you. Only a total fool or someone who doesn't care about losing all their money would use MoneyGram now. Read all the horror stories in the 1 & 2 star reviews and see how safe you feel about giving your money to MoneyGram. It's very likely that's exactly what you'll actually be doing....giving them your money. Every reply given to the reviews is very obviously rubber stamped and completely meaningless. Nearly all of them say the exact same thing that is senseless, worthless, and useless drivel. That is certainly not how a decent caring company replies to it's customers. But they shouldn't have to reply to so many angry customers in the first place if they were doing their job instead of ripping people off.UPDATE: As you can see they gave me their pathetic rubber stamp reply they give to the majority of reviews and it's obviously completely meaningless garbage with no attempt whatsoever to resolve anything. That's because they care nothing about their customers.",

        "text": "Review of MoneyGram Services in London: A Frustrating ExperienceIf you’re considering using MoneyGram in London, I strongly urge you to think twice. While the platform promises global convenience, the reality is a nightmare if you’re trying to receive money here. The problem isn’t with sending money—MoneyGram makes that process relatively smooth—but with actually finding a location in London where you can receive it.After sending funds internationally, you’d expect to find a reliable network of partners to withdraw your money. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Many of the listed agents in London either no longer exist, refuse to provide MoneyGram services, or are simply non-functional. Some outlets claim they’re “out of cash” or “don’t have the facility,” leaving recipients stranded and frustrated. Even major establishments that should support MoneyGram transactions, such as post offices or shops, often turn customers away with unhelpful responses.The experience of locating a MoneyGram partner that actually fulfills their advertised service becomes an exhausting scavenger hunt. What’s worse, MoneyGram’s customer service seems disinterested in resolving these issues. Their representatives suggest you “try another location,” which is absurd when one after another fails to meet expectations. It seems that the responsibility of ensuring the availability of partner locations is completely neglected.MoneyGram in London might still serve as a viable option for sending money, but without a functional and dependable receiving network, what’s the point? It’s essentially half a service. You might send funds to someone in need, only for them to face the frustrating reality of wandering around London in search of a partner willing to release the money.In conclusion, MoneyGram’s receiving services in London are poorly managed and unreliable. If you’re looking for a dependable way to send money internationally, I’d strongly recommend exploring other providers like Western Union, PayPal, or even bank transfers. Save yourself and your recipient the hassle. MoneyGram’s failures in London make it an option best avoided. So please if you read this , make a change on how MoneyGram works and make MoneyGram branches so we don’t relay your on shops where they never have money to cash out!",

I felt like i was introgated by a farud govt authority. I never face this type of introfation when i sent money by wearern union. It was not a large amount of money only for $1000. I believe i shouldnt went throw this process. Even moneygram never contact me via email or sms to contact customer service for security questions. I told customer service that if they see my record i sent one particular family memebr everymonth same amount of money for family expenses. But i had to go throw same shit 90% of times when i sent money. I decided not to use moneygram service anymore. Because i dont like to go through this process.",

It was a weekend and it said on the app 0 -1 business days. It said the money was on its way. But it didn't arrive for 3 days. My daughters electricity was shut off and she has my 9 year old grandson in her home. If I has gone to a store that has Money Gram she would have received the money instantly. I don't feel the app is very good if someone needs money on the same day, because they will have to wait up to 5 business days for the money to clear their account. I couldn't do anything because you had already taken the money out of my bank account with in minutes of me sending the money. Yet my daughter had to wait 3 days to receive it.",

Since cancelling the contract with the Post Office, Tesco etc, I have not been able to pick up money from the remaining locations due to them not 'having any or enough money'. There are around 10 small locations which are usually tiny grocery stores. They tell me to come back in a few days, but when I do someone else has already taken the money. After contacting Moneygram to offer a solution where I could receive a bank transfer instead (especially seeing as they now have £1500 of money to give me), I was told I could have the money transferred. I was then told, I could not have the money transferred to my bank and that the sender would need to cancel all the transactions, request a refund, and send the money again via bank transfer. Crap service. Cheap.  Update 9th Dec - since requesting the refund, the sender was told it would take up to 15 days and WILL NOT include the sending fee. If they want to include the sending fee, it will take 3 months?! Are these companies real in the head?",

MG policy is we do not refund fraud. If the fraudster collects money then they will definitely not refund. Apparently they are contractually obliged to give money to them even if you report the fraud. I complained and they continue to give the same response.

While I understand the need for security measures, the lack of transparency and communication from MoneyGram has been deeply disappointing.I was informed that my account was flagged as \"high risk\" for fraud or scams, but no specific details were provided. I’ve repeatedly reached out to MoneyGram for clarification and offered to provide proof of my identity, including my passport, driving license, tenancy agreement, and bank statements, yet I have received no meaningful response or guidance on how to resolve the issue.The entire process feels automated and impersonal, leaving me with no clear path to unlocking my account or addressing the concerns raised. As a loyal customer who has followed MoneyGram’s terms and conditions, this experience has been disheartening and inconvenient.I strongly urge MoneyGram to improve their customer service by:Providing detailed reasons for account suspensions.Offering clear, step-by-step instructions to resolve account issues.Ensuring customers have access to live support representatives for urgent concerns.Until these improvements are made, I would advise potential users to consider other money transfer services that offer better communication and customer support.",

Suddenly, I received an email saying my account was permanently closed — without any detailed reason or chance to clarify. I’ve always used the platform responsibly, provided all documents when requested, and have nothing to hide.What’s most frustrating is the lack of transparency and communication. I reached out for a manual review but received a generic response saying they can’t disclose more. This experience has left me feeling unfairly treated and concerned about how decisions are being made.I used Wise for important personal/business payments, and now I’ve been forced to scramble for alternatives. I understand Wise has compliance responsibilities, but customers deserve clearer communication and a chance to be heard.Really disappointed — I hope Wise improves how it handles such cases and treats customers with more respect.",

I have actively used five different currencies and have filled up my account from four different countries and currencies. Wise is transparent with fees and I have never felt overcharged. The only thing I can think of on the con side is that I have seen my specific currency account number (the one I use to receive funds in Wise) change several times. That is not a big problem as such. I just always need to check my account before doing a transfer to Wise. But, it does say something about what the traditional banking world think about a service like Wise.",

That's fine, even if their UX was horrible and deadlocked at this stage. What  I don't like is that is also impossible to fully delete the account, since I now have no use for it. You can only disable it, and after doing this you get a mail with a link to what is supposed to be information about how long your data will be stored. This link is behind a login page, so you can only read the information meant for customer that has closed their account if they reactive their account. The only other way to contact them about getting your account fully deleted is by calling the customer service, which is not a free number. There you will put on hold and see your money tick away, only to get to know that they don't have a standard process for this. Following GDPR much?",

The problem is, I'm still waiting on Wise to return the small payments I made that didn't reach their receiver. I don't see how this could be viewed as anything but fraud on Wise's part. I paid them for a service - transferring money to another Wise account - and they decided not to provide me with that service but also haven't refunded my money. There is really no way to view this other than simply fraud on the part of Wise.If anyone is reading this, you do have options: if you're in the states (like I am) file complaints with your state Department of Commerce. Also file one with the CFPB. And then call your state attorney general's office and ask if you can file a complaint with them directly or if they can refer you to other services.It's also possible to file a complaint in the UK with ActionFraud. Please do so! It's likely the best option for receiving money back that Wise has scammed from however many people they've scammed money from. And it's important to file these complaints because the more complaints that are officially filed the higher the likelihood that some governmental agency will take action against Wise and hopefully stop them from committing fraud against other unsuspecting victims.",

June 2025 about a sudden inactivation and then closure of my Wise account on 2 June 2025.I decided to close my account but had to go through a complaints procedure to get something of an active response, BUTI complained on the 23 June 2025 (Reference No : 39037861) asking for a full final copy of my Wise account statement (as no longer directly accessible to me) and transfer of the positive balance to my account by postal cheque.I received a reply 7th July 2025, having to send a selfie with photo ID card before the outcome of the 'investigation' is being sent. I did so.They then insisted that I send a bank statement for proof of account as they' doo not use postal cheques', but I believe that this is excessive and has its own security risk.Instead I sent a selfie on the same day, holding my bank card with account and sort code visible.I finally did decide to send a bank statement on the 16 July 2025, but I had no acknowledgement or reply to this email, in other words the email trail about my complaint has gone stone-cold on Wise's side.I can only assume that complaints either have a low priority or there are too many complaints for the existing team to handle....So after 7 weeks, endless emails, 2 phone calls (that achieved nothing) and a complaint following the sudden freeze and closure of my account by Wise (2nd June 2025), Wise is still sitting on my money.",

It should have arrived by now.”We still don’t have it and I still have to wait.The whole process is a farce. We all know money transfers are immediate. I cannot establish why they are not sending this money over.Don’t be fooled by a good service initially, it’s all good until it goes wrong then it goes wrong spectacularly.I decided to raise a formal complaint. I was appointed someone one by the name of Rekha, guess what, no response there either.This is so stressful and worrying and they simply don’t care.See other 1 star reviews before you trust your money with this lot.I have reported them to RIP Off Britain and Martin Lewis. The Financial Ombudsman will be notified today. If anyone else has a similar story please do the same. Let’s raise awareness on this awful service to stop others suffering.",

They fully exploit the stated timeframe of 2–5 days before crediting funds, even though the money was sent the same day via an express transfer from my bank.Wise’s excuse is that the intermediary banks take that long, and they claim to be doing everything possible to provide a pleasant experience for the customer.However, small amounts are credited within minutes – conveniently.I am very dissatisfied, as the support team replies anonymously and cannot tell me when exactly my money will arrive. In 2025! And the customer is left guessing whether everything is running smoothly.So yes – Wise might be okay for pocket-money transfers, but in my opinion, it’s not suitable for anything beyond that.Also, there are recurring errors in the stock investment plan credits. You really need to stay alert everywhere.",

        "text": "Signed a deal with big cellphone distribution company, that unfortunately uses \"Wise\" for their transfers.  \"Wise\", has intensive and intrusive security entry protocols that make utilizing this service, more difficult than you think.  Annoyingly difficult, borderline control mechanised company.So, I am forced to go through their security detail, even though I am only sending money to the distributors.Setting this up is not an easy task, it really isn't.Firstly as an example, if you want to use your driving licence as your ID. You are told to take a picture of the front of the driving licence, then a picture of the back of the driving licence.First bit, no problems, uploaded.The second bit, there appears to be a major glitch on the Wise website / platform, that basically is forcing the camera to turn around, rather than facing downwards, in order to take the photo required.It makes no logical sense why they would want a picture of the back of your driving licence either. The only information on the back of a UK driving licence, is what car you can drive, as in its code.So baffled as to why it is demanded a copy of the back of your driving licence is required.But I cannot take picture of the back of the driving licence anyway, because the \"Wise\" camera, refuses to point downwards, which means trying to take a picture of something, pointing the phone camera down, does not work at all.Disappointed with this \"Wise\". Another payments system that is riddled with security protocol, control mechanisms and poorly executed again.So I now have orders that have been paid for on Ebay, that are not going to be honoured, because of \"Wise\".This causes a massive issue. I do not recommend any company to use \"Wise\".Just use regular payment systems, like \"Paypal\", who are not much better, but at least you have not got to take photos of yourselves every-time you want to send a payment.Your security detail is too intrusive, for the product you offer, which is a basic money transfer service.Not even Paypal has such ridiculous measures, and they are pretty backwards, in all honesty.Thanks for causing me much stress, thanks for being ignorant and I recommend that you somehow go bankrupt in the near future, so to force the company I am dealing with to use another provider for their money transfers.Do not respond with the usual, we are right and you are wrong replies, that companies always seem to put on Trustpilot. NO, I am not interested in anything you have to say.You are an inefficiently set up organisation that should be removed from the public domain.Thank you.",

Some time ago they changed their policies to take away guaranteed rates if you had too many cancelled transactions. I complied with the new policy to get my guaranteed rate back, which I did through many more transfers. However, despite this, they have taken away my guaranteed rate again even when I have consistently gone through with all transfers immediately. I don’t understand why except that I created a lone duplicate transfer (out of more than 10 - and of course they gave me the lower rate when I made the singular transfer). They took away the guaranteed rate again, which for my last transfer somehow left me with the lowest rate over the entire week. When businesses grow, customer loyalty goes out the window. I have probably made over 50 transfers with their company. I feel disappointed now with their policy of suspending the guaranteed rate capriciously.",

        "text": "I was genuinely delighted with Wise and the overall quality of its service. However, discovering how sensitively the system reacts to international transfers—and how uncertain the reactivation process can be—has taken away much of my motivation to continue using Wise.I fully understand the importance of compliance with Wise’s usage guidelines. Still, deactivating an entire account due to a suspicious transaction—without offering a clear explanation or time frame—significantly diminishes the value of an otherwise excellent product.Suggestions for Improvement:1. Block or reject specific suspicious transactions—ideally with a brief explanation—rather than deactivating the entire account. Locking users out of their full account and credit balance can cause serious financial hardship, especially when the wrong people are affected.2. Engage with the customer before deactivation. A serious financial institution would first seek a conversation to understand the context, rather than making irreversible decisions based on automated flags alone.3. Provide transparent reasoning. If the only explanation given is a vague reference to a “breach of usage policy,” customers are left guessing. It’s nearly impossible to defend or appeal a decision without understanding what exactly triggered it.4. Ensure reactivation is as fast as deactivation. It’s extremely stressful to rely on funds held with Wise and then face a total account freeze—without any guarantee or timeline for when access will be restored.If Wise were to take some of the more desperate Trustpilot reviews to heart, rather than defending or rationalizing this questionable strategy, it could easily evolve into the perfect product. The foundation is already strong—what’s needed is more transparency, communication, and customer trust during edge-case scenarios.",

The fees are not clear and the customer service is a disaster: My business account's virtual card got hacked without any prior history and I was losing money on my account for some random website in Philippines. Luckily, I saw the incident realtime so was able to freeze the card and prevent the biggest damage. 6 months and dozens of messages later I still haven't got any explanation why this happened and my virtual card history just got wiped out to destroy the evidence. It looked like they had some bug in their virtual cards and I lost my trust on that moment and moved everything away from Wise.Another poor experience was when I opened my paid business account assuming I'd be able to get local US bank details and credit card payment option for my clients. 1.5 years and several requests later neither of these have happened so don't assume you will be able to get the features they are marketing.If you're a business owner, do yourself a favor and check out amnis which has actual humans in customer service and where your money is insured up to 100k. Unlike Wise, it provides you local bank details instantly for several countries (including US) and they are continuously  adding new features as well.",

But this year, I’m getting really “scared” by how they are doing business.For the second time this year, they asked for my business documents and I sent it at the moment of the request. The issue? They put a block on the account until they review the documents and even blocked the card so all normal payments dont work.Talking with the support, she was not helpful and only pastting legal copy to tell me to wait for 48hSo, they have my money, ask documents (that they already have) and block the full account (withouy any reason or crazy new moviment in the account).This time, I’m really rethinking the use of Wise in my business and life, and starting considering that I should use Revolut and ignore Wise … and for sure I’m not recommending it anymore, as looks like its not safe to use it.Edit: I got a weird automated reply from Wise team on the Google review.Be aware, it’s getting almost clear that Wise can’t be trusted anymore.PS: this all happened after I requested the creation of a new business account here in Czech Republic, paid 1150czk (50usd) to open accounts, and after it all I just closed it without use as I cant trust Wise anymore (and of course they took the payment as a gift).Stay away if you care about your money.",

I was amazed. Not only that, but I was kept updated every step of the way.What really sets Wise apart is the trust and clarity. No hidden charges, no confusing processes—just a reliable, efficient service that does exactly what it promises.I can confidently say this was my best ever experience with any financial service. Highly recommended to anyone who needs to send or receive money across borders.Thank you, Wise!",

        "text": "When you search the web for setting your Wise account as your default account to receive e-transfer payments, there are clear instructions to do it. However, after I open the account, I simply couldn't set my Wise account as the default account to receive money. I called the support, they couldn't give an answer and had to get back to me through an email. I got the email later and they said I just couldn't receive money through e-transfer. There is a chance that I could do it later on.So, if you open a Wise account and hope something would work, don't count on it. There are lots of instabilities currently. I also feel that their preferred way to add money to the account is quite sketchy. You have to provide your bank card number and the password to Wise. My bank simply doesn't allow me to do that and forced me to change the password. Something for you to consider before you open a Wise account.The following is an update after Wise's reply. Wise implied that e-transfer is not supported in certain countries like Canada. This indicates that the person who replied have not done any research. My friend has a Wise account, and he can set his Wise account as the default receiver for e-transfer. Wise definitely supports e-transfer in Canada. This reply is typical of Wise's support.",

        "text": "I changed my address from Macedonia to Germany to receive a Wise card while working abroad. Support told me I could verify my account with official German documents like the Meldebestätigung, but then the app didn’t allow me to upload anything useful.For days I’ve been stuck in support chats where every agent gives a different answer, keeps repeating the same things, and no one actually solves the issue. I sent everything they asked for — passport, ID, even registration documents — and still no progress.I lost time, energy, and nearly my salary trying to use Wise in Germany. It’s a shame, because the idea is great, but the execution and customer support are unbelievably bad.I do NOT recommend Wise if you’re a student, traveler, or someone needing fast access to your money abroad.",

I thought oh that must be worst case scenario - it’s always been instant in the past. But here it is Tuesday and still no sign of the funds.

This kind of practice is unacceptable, especially in the UK. You can’t just shut down accounts and hide behind automated messages. Very disappointing.(After reading their reply ...)Thank you for your reply, although I find it extremely vague and disappointing.You mention “reasonable security measures” and “sufficient reason” without specifying anything. I believe that closing a personal account with no prior warning, no explanation, and no specific allegations is neither reasonable nor respectful towards your customers.If there was a genuine issue, I have the right to be informed. Otherwise, this feels more like a random and unjustified closure, and it raises serious concerns about how Wise treats its users and their funds.Also, asking me to go through multiple pages and vague links just to get a refund receipt shows a lack of transparency and poor customer care.I would appreciate a clear and specific explanation of why my account was closed, and I believe others should know how you operate.",

However, when I purchased flights overseas in my local currency (AUD) I accidentally entered my local credit card CSV and expiry date but my Wise credit card number. I would have thought that because the details were incorrect this transaction would be rejected. On other occassions, even when the details are correct I am prompted to approve it on the Wise website. However, the transaction went through immediately and because I didnt have and AUD in my account Wise took it upon themselves to exchange all my currencies back to AUD. Of course, Wise made money on this transaction. Although I called Wise immediately I was told there was nothing they could do. Luckily, the airline was more helpful and refunded the money. However, it returned to my account 2 days later and the exchange rate had dropped plus Wise wanted to charge me n admin fee again for changing my money back to the way it was prior to them approving the transaction. Worse part is that despite my numerous emails and chats nobody has responded to why this occurred and what can be done. I am now hundreds of dollars out of pocket. The product when it works is amazing and a simple call or email could have solved my issues and resulted in me not writing this review. Customer service is as important as having a good product.",

I was not even given a chance to resolve the situation before a permanent decision was made.As a verified small business owner, this abrupt closure has severely impacted my operations, and the lack of human review in such cases is alarming. I urge Wise to not hide behind general policy links, please treat your loyal customers fairly, especially when they reach out in good faith.I respectfully request:A detailed explanation of the exact reason for closure.A genuine re-evaluation of my case.Automation should never replace empathy and fairness.#WiseSupport #AccountClosedUnfairly #ReopenMyAccount #SmallBusinessMatters",

        "title": "Extremely Disappointing Experience with Wise Support – Will Never Use Again",
        "text": "I spent over 40 minutes on a landline call with a Wise support representative named Yeghin, who, rather than assisting me, gave misleading information in an apparent attempt to end the call prematurely.The issue was simple but urgent: my wife, who is currently living in Vietnam, needed to transfer funds to me. She attempted to create and verify a Wise account but couldn’t get past the phone number verification stage. Regardless of whether she selected SMS, WhatsApp, or Voice Call, she kept getting the same error: “We are unable to send an SMS to your number.” Since calling the US or UK support numbers would have been prohibitively expensive, her only option was to email support, which she did. She received a case number and an automated response stating it could take 24 hours or more for a reply which was completely unacceptable given the urgency.I called Wise on her behalf using my own account, offered to verify both my identity and hers, and provided to the representative all necessary details to help resolve the login issue. Despite this, the representative ignored what I was saying and claimed that if my wife simply emailed again, she would receive a response “within minutes.” When I asked if she could stay on the line to ensure that happened, she refused, saying it might take up to an hour or more. Upon further questioning, she finally admitted that the wait time could, in fact, still be 24 hours or longer.Throughout the call, I passed all security checks for my own account, and I was prepared to share all of my wife’s credentials and security details. I even connected my mobile to my wife's mobile via speakerphone so the operator could speak with her directly. Still, no assistance was provided, even though the issue was simply a login problem—not a transaction or security risk—and my wife’s identity could have been easily verified.This experience was incredibly frustrating, especially given the urgency of the situation and our willingness to cooperate fully.It’s only when you have a genuine emergency and really need help that you discover how good a company truly is. I have used Wise to transfer hundreds of thousands of pounds over the past year. That ends now. I’ll be taking my business to one of the many other companies that offer a better service. I will never use Wise again.**EDIT – After reaching out to Wise three more times and spending a total of 75 minutes on the telephone I received no meaningful help. I eventually discovered - through a Reddit post, not Wise themselves - that it's not possible to create a Wise account or send money from Vietnam.At no point was this ever communicated to me or my wife by Wise support, despite multiple attempts to get assistance. It's incredibly concerning that even senior support staff seem unaware of such a fundamental limitation of their own service.When Wise works, it works well. But when something goes wrong, you're left completely in the dark, with incompetent support and zero transparency. For a company handling people's money, that's simply unacceptable. Wise fell woefully short of even the most basic standards of customer service in our case.**",

        "text": "I submitted an appeal 20 days ago after Wise closed my account. I provided the required bank statement – but no one contacted me to say it was wrong. Only when I reached out myself did I finally hear back.A support agent admitted in a call that Wise made a mistake – they failed to explain that the bank statement had to come from an external source, not their own app. She later sent an email confirming it was Wise’s error and asked me to submit a new appeal, assuring me it would be handled faster.But why should I wait another 20 days (or more) because of their mistake?During all this time, I’ve repeatedly explained that I urgently need access to my funds – I’m literally living on borrowed money. It’s completely unreasonable to expect people to survive without access to their own finances, especially over weekends and holidays when money is needed the most.I understand the need for compliance checks if there’s a suspicion – that’s normal. But everything already took 20 days. Starting again from zero is unfair, unacceptable, and inhumane.Wise, this is not just poor service – it’s a real hardship caused by your internal miscommunication. Please fix this and release my funds immediately.Dear Wise Appeals TeamI am writing to formally request a re-evaluation of my appeal regarding the frozen funds in my account.I have submitted all the requested documents, including the additional bank statement from a different financial institution (outside of Wise), as instructed during my last communication with your support team.More than 20 days have passed since my most recent appeal submission, and I have still not received any updates regarding the status of my case. When I contacted your support team after the initial 20-day delay, I was told that no one had followed up because the additional bank statement had not been provided — even though this requirement was never previously communicated to me. I was then instructed to resubmit my appeal with the new document and wait another 20 days.This situation has now been ongoing for over 60 days, which I believe is unacceptable. I am facing serious financial hardship, and I want to emphasize that I genuinely need access to these funds. I have fully complied with all your requirements and submitted everything asked of me. Therefore, I believe that withholding my money under these circumstances may be unlawful and should be reviewed immediately.I kindly ask you to treat this matter with the urgency it requires and provide a clear update on the current status of my appeal, along with a timeline for resolution.",

Our children and grandchildren live in the UK so being able to transfer funds from and to UK/Germany was a must.  We were on a cruise last year in the Caribbean and visited 10 different islands, 4 different currencies and Wise worked seamlessly, it is important that you have trust in a company that is holding your funds.  Transactions notified to you within seconds, we are going on another cruise in September USA and Canada, my Wise card is already notified to the cruise company and will be used for all necessary payments, Euro, US Dollar and Canadian Dollar.",

I am very happy with Wise.On the downside I didn’t realise there was a limit on how many cash withdrawals from an ATM in one month. Apparently 2 and then you are charged a percentage and withdrawal fee on top of the withdrawal fee of the country you are in.I have already paid a fee to convert money so don’t understand why I have to pay another fee to take that currency of the country I am in. We are travelling 8 countries over 4 months and spending one month in two of those countries so to be limited to atm cash withdrawals is frustrating as the atms have a limit on how much you can get out.That is my only con otherwise everything is great. Also love the alerts you get as soon as you have used the card.",

Wise kept making excuses.  The account information was all correct.  We asked for a wire trace and told the wire went out.  Yet no funds.In the second week, Wise asked UBS to issue a wire rejection letter, which they could not do bc no wire was received.  More excuses from Wise‘s underpaid, understaffed group of employees.  No responsibility whatsoever.At the end of the third week, the 18th of July, Wise sent a request to return payment of the wire at 8AM, and at 10AM payment was received!  UBS refused the request, bc they knew the situation, but Wise was literally trying to prolong the process.Highly unprofessional organization ruining counterpart companies.  DO NOT USE!

Your bank might take up to 3 days to get it to us. We'll let you know when it's arrived. Monday, 14 July at 10:18 we receive your GBP. Monday at 10:18 we pay out your GBP.\". That was a lie. I checked my accounts, even tried again with another \"sure\" date and time. Finally, I had to do an international transfer through my bank, losing me a lot of money. It was that, or lose the house!Ill still use the top-up card but never again will I trust Wise with a life-changing sum of money.",

        "text": "As a retired resident of a country that is not my native origin, it's necessary to handle cross-currency transactions quite routinely. Wise handles this seamlessly and economically both by direct transfer and by debit card. When currency conversions need to be made, it's really quick and easy to monitor the exchange rates - or to set a 'trigger' rate - to make best advantage. Foreign travel is just a breeze - with a debit card that permits the holder to make payments just like a 'local'. I've never experienced a glitch of any sort with Wise, it works for me wonderfully well and I recommend it.",

As a consequence I need funds easily and securely available in the countries I am visiting. Euros, British pounds and American dollars are my most common requirement. Wise provides the best exchange rates and lowest fees that I have been able to find. I particularly like the almost instant email reporting any time I use my debit card. I do think they could improve their website for making on line payments to third parties and also for depositing funds in to my own account. I find they are not clear or intuitive in their requirements. No doubt, in time, I will become used to it but as I generally only transfer funds once or twice a year becoming familiar with their process is rather slow.

        "text": "I’ve been using Wise since 2014, and up until recently, I found their service exceptional—efficient and reliable. However, things have changed. They’ve started refusing to send routine payments they’ve handled for me for years, including my monthly Barclaycard payment and an annual subscription to a market data provider. When I asked why, I received vague responses like “we can’t give any extra information due to regulations” and “this transaction is outside our risk appetite.” It’s frustrating and disappointing to see a service I trusted become so unhelpful and opaque.18 July 2025: Addendum added in response to Wise's reply:The success of fintechs like Wise lies in their supposed efficiency, transparency, and agility compared to traditional banks. Yet the service I’ve encountered recently reflects the opposite. In fact, Wise now comes a poor second even to high-street banks, which would at least have transmitted my Barclaycard payment and my annual TradingView subscription without issue.Refusing to send clients’ money for perfectly legal and proper purposes is not just inconvenient — it’s offensive. Are Wise trying to destroy their own business? I’ve already opened an account with another provider and will be moving my business there.Finally, while I note Wise’s offer to “double-check” the payments, I had already raised these issues and received a response to each. It’s unclear what purpose another check would serve beyond repetition.",

The rates are great, it's user-friendly, great website, etc, but when you need to contact them, it's difficult to find a phone number. Just put the number on the website and make it easy for us. Or even better, make it easy for customers to change details like address and phone number online so we don't have to call. Thanks.",

The anxiety associated with that is undesirable as I travel to other countries and sometimes i need the money now !  I pay rent and for example in Brazil they only want to be paid by “Pix” so I rely on a friend for making the payement and I reimburse her.  Anyway the web site or the App does not operate consistently and intuitively.  I am sometimes given a choice prior to submit to add money via a debit or credit and other methods with different rates to get it in minutes or hours. That choice the last time was not available. The person on the phone walked me through and she witness this discrepancy. I then tried on my tablet then on a PC accessing my account via a web instead of the app and still that reference page was gone.  The only choice I was left with was 4 Bussiness days. My rent was late. But the Air&B landlord was understanding .   I suppose depending on the day this is a love and hate relationships. I literally have to calculate my strategy every time in fear of the system to not cooperate.   Also now in my transaction history i cant see my all my information such as canceling my transfer information which i used to discuss with the support center. They see it but i dont and i used to. Perhaps a tab just for those should be available.",

This is a Vanguard CashPlus account (administered by PNC but can't log in through PNC).  So I sent an email asking how to do it since instant verification through Plaid will fail.  And instead of fixing their systems, they just put me on the merry-go-round of approximately 10 emails.  Even after sending them many screenshots showing there is NO option they refer to, they insist on my having to call them.  I asked them to send me the screenshots showing where the option they refer to is, and their response: We don't send screenshots.  We are WISE.  I felt like they must have \"Wise über alles\" as their company anthem and song.Anyway, the way forward is simple: reduce the dependence on Wise and eliminate it as time goes by.  Good luck Wise and good tidings.UPDATE after First WISE Reply: Wise is very WISE and accordingly, they have deployed WiseAI to provide Cookie Cutter responses to reviews.  The reply is useless, non-contextual, and does not address the unique issue I have.  What a Waste.",

        "text": "I recently completed an international transfer from the USA to Norway. When I initiated the transfer, I was shown a guaranteed exchange rate, which I fully understand was only valid if the funds were received by Wise within 8 hours. However it took 4 days for Wise to receive the funds, so the guaranteed rate had expired, and the mid-market rate at the time of conversion should have been applied instead.By the time the conversion occurred, the USD had strengthened significantly. Based on that, I was expecting to receive more in NOK than originally quoted — just as I would have expected to receive less had the USD weakened during that same period.This is not what happened,  my frustration, it appears that Wise reverted back to the expired guaranteed rate rather than applying the mid-market rate as stated in the agreement. This resulted in a difference of around $400, which I feel is being unfairly pocketed by Wise.I’ve contacted customer service, but so far the responses have been unhelpful and generic. What’s even more frustrating is receiving emails from Wise customer service that don’t allow replies, making it difficult to have a productive conversation.Ref. Wise's Response:According to Wise’s own stated policy explained in Wise's answer, the mid-market rate at the time of conversion should have been used. However, Wise instead applied a guaranteed rate that had expired four days before the funds were even received.By relying on this outdated rate — contrary to the policy they outlined — Wise effectively shorted the conversion. Had the correct rate been used, I would have received approximately $400 more than I did since the exchange rates was much more favorable at the time that they received the funds . Instead, I feel that Wise benefited from the difference, at my expense.This is both disappointing and unethical.",

In fact the only advice Wise gave was - we don't need to help you - GO TALK TO THE OTHER BANK ON YOUR OWN!!**The customer service is a disasterThey have no knowledge of banking operational processes. This causes two serious issues. 1) Unless very basic, they don't know how to answer questions eg why an ATM debit at BPI appeared as Security bank at a completely different location (twice) on the bank statement thus causing a false 250php fee in error. 2) Worse still, they lie or say anything to close the case because they don't understand the problem, refuse to speak to BPI and refuse to refer it to their technical teams and say speaking to managers is impossible. My case was closed 4 times and they refuse to refund illegal charges.",

        "text": "There was a time - not too long ago, when I would have sung Wise' praise. However, just within the last 60 to 90 days, dramatic changes have occurred that, in my humble opinion will cause Wise to lose a lot of clients. 1. Transfers no longer occur within seconds and never on weekends, Transfer speed was Wise' strongest market positioning. It's no longer the case.2. Wise policy changes are coming hard and fast, Customers are also seldom aware of such changes until after the fact.3. Wise seems to have opted for marginal changes in lower market rates at the expense of transfer speed.Money sent on Friday, is now delivered on Monday afternoon at best - its as if Wise loses its connections to local gateways or they are deliberately managing the float for 2 to 3  days.",

        "text": "It would have been an easy 5 stars from me right until they decided to close my account for no apparent reason, or if there was one they are not willing to share it. I switched from Payoneer to Wise because friends told me it was a better way to get paid, and for a long time I used their excellent service without much hassle. I was getting paid globally easily and also paying for anything or anyone without issues. I don't know if it was because of my country of residence but a while back, Wise removed my USD receiving account info so I had to switch to EUR for all my payments (that added some conversion fees, but it was better than nothing and I was used to Wise at this point so didn't make sense to make the switch to another platform.) I was able to use my virtual Wise card without any issues on a lot of platforms, in different countries when I was traveling and so on. The experience was great. But then... last week, without any prior notice, my account was closed. I was given absolutely no reason for why this was happening. I guess that's just how they work: they can close your account with out any notice and they are not required to provide a reason as well. This doesn't make sense at all. Anyways there was the option to make an appeal and I did so but it was rejected. The worst part is since Wise was my primary bank account, all my funds were primarily on it. Now I have no way of accessing it and support just says the money is being refunded and that's that. Really disappointed in how things ended but it was a great service while they were willing to provide it for me. I'm sure a lot of people will make a great use out of it. But it might not be the best option for people from Ethiopia (I think they no longer support Ethiopia even, which is sad.) Payoneer and Dukascopy are better alternatives if you are from Ethiopia or a country they are no longer willing to support.",

        "text": "I really liked this company as long as everything went smoothly. But when I needed to rely on customer service, no reasonable conversation was possible, no argument was listened to. What happened was that I requested a transfer from my Wise account to my UK account. In the personal memo section, I mentioned the first name of my niece, a student in the UK, just as a reminder to myself that some of the money should be earmarked for her. Wise reacted by requesting the full name and the National ID # of my niece. I gave them the full name and a website that listed her as a PhD student of a London University. I also directly informed the receiving bank who the person mentioned in the memo line was – she is in their system from other transfers. My UK bank  credited the transfer, they were satisfied with the information I provided. They seem to have understood that I could not responsibly transmit highly sensitive information (corresponding to a Social Security Number in the US) via a simple e-mail, in particular since that information was not about the recipient of the transfer, but merely about a person mentioned in the personal memo line. Wise however reacted by proceeding to close my account since I did not give them the requested information. They claimed I violated their user agreement, but never specified the nature of the violation – they never  mentioned the relevant clause in the agreement. When I filed a complaint, they simply sent the user agreement, again without specifying why they think any of its clauses was violated. They are now going to close my account. They never responded to my argument that the information they requested was not information that I was entitled to paste into an e-mail. They also never acknowledged that I did provide information to both them and the receiving bank that allowed them to uniquely identify my niece without security risks and in a way that would normally eliminate any suspicion about improper uses. If Wise had normal customer service that allowed you to actually interact with a particular person, this kind of problem would have never arisen - the problem would have disappeared after a single conversation. In my case, every e-mail I got was signed by a different person (first name only, no phone number, no way to reach the same person again). Given the nature of the responses (making the same point over and over), I wasn't even sure that I was connected to an actual person.The reply from Wise again did not address my specific concern, confirming my impression that they either select from canned responses or employ some mediocre AI.",

I’ve been so impressed that I even opened a business account, which allows me to receive payments in both USD and AUD — a massive advantage for international business.Even now that I’m back in New Zealand, I’m still using my Wise card and plan to keep doing so.

The fair and transparent exchange rates on foreign transactions/credit card transactions in foreign currencies, together with low transaction costs, are particularly positive features. The only negative point (in my case) is the lack of a ‘proper’ Swiss IBAN for the CHF account. For Swiss residents, this is unfortunately a BE number, which cannot be used as a payout account with Stripe, for example. From this perspective, I would give it 4.9 stars.

They informed me to provide them information I did exactly that they said it would take 2 business days to get fixed. It’s been 2 weeks!! I call, email, text every day and get brushed off every single time!! I’m starting to think this is a scam. I have a terminally ill father who is in chemo and they’re restricting me from my hard earned money!! They have showed 0 care or humility on the situation. I’m already stressed out of my mind with my situation and I feel like they’ve taken me for a total ride. The most horrible experience I’ve ever had in my life. PLEASE CAN SOMEONE JUST TAKE 5 mins out of their time to look at the ticket and fix it!!! I’m on the verge of a mental break down at this point JUST HELP ME!!!",

It’s now been 3 days, and I still have no access to the funds.I was initially told — by what felt like an AI response — that it was a “known issue” with their partner and it would be resolved within a day. It wasn’t.I then received conflicting information: one agent blamed my bank (it wasn’t my bank), and another claimed they’d retry the transfer — but instead, they canceled it without my consent.I explained that I urgently needed this money to pay for housing and basic living costs, and yet I received no meaningful response or action. No one took ownership. No one escalated my case properly. I was denied access to a manager.The end result? I lost the condo I was supposed to move into, and I’ve been left with no funds to live because of Wise’s handling of this situation.A company holding customer funds like this, providing zero real support, and refusing escalation during a crisis should not be in the business of money transfers.Avoid Wise — especially if you're relying on them for urgent transfers.

On this occasion, all details I provided—including his full name and identification—accurately matched his government-issued licence, as required.However, your staff member, Lianie, not only withheld the funds, but also made my nephew wait for more than two hours, and then unexpectedly demanded a birth certificate without any valid explanation. This requirement was never mentioned as part of your identification policy, and it caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.To make matters worse, when I called the branch to respectfully inquire about the situation, the person I spoke with hung up on me, which I find to be highly disrespectful and unprofessional.This kind of treatment is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the level of service and customer care one should expect from a reputable remittance company. I request that this matter be:1. Investigated and clarified, particularly the reason for the withholding of funds and the request for a birth certificate.2. Addressed internally to ensure that no other customer experiences similar delays and disrespect.3. Met with a formal apology from the branch concerned and a clear explanation of the identification policy that was applied.Please confirm receipt of this complaint and advise on the steps you will take to resolve this issue. I look forward to your prompt and professional response.",

So Worldremit assuming you are not able to resolve this, it has been 23 days, I do not see how waiting another 23 days is going to resolve this, what is the next steps, what does your manual tell you to do next?",

He went on 2 July to collect the money and was told that they could not download the transactions. He then presented the collection notice I had received on 1 July. He was asked to contact World Remit for explanation.On 1 July, I contacted online and chatted to Naida and was promised that it would take 2 days to investigate. I contacted again on 4 July and chatted with Alex. I was told they had not received information from local agents. I also phoned on the same day and got the promise that I would get notification email and reference number. I phoned again on 8 July and was promised we would get an email in 3 hours time to confirm the investigation report. I have not received the investigation report or email by the end of the day.On 9 July I phoned again and spoke to Rick and was told the usual line that no response has been received from our agent: Rick promised to escalate the case to his manager.On Friday 11 July I phoned again and was promised that supervisors Kim/Kena will call me between 2-2.15pm UK time but again no phone call came.I am frustrated that this was emergency money and two weeks on I am not any wiser what happened to my transfer. World Remit reputation is at stake here. The investigation and communication process has not been great. I am not sure customer service is a priority for World Remit.23 Days later I still don't know what happened to my money and I still has not spoken to anyone from World Remit.After 24 Days today World Remit sent the following as proof of payment from their agent, which is joke.

Their attention line has almost always waiting times of more than 30 mins and their specialist can never resolve anything, only forward emails to other teams that are supposed to contact you, but never do. It has been 8 months and my issue has not been resolved. I obviously do not want to use this service anymore; however, I would like to acces my account to retrieve my transaction history for tax purposes. However, this is not possible, since my account is still deactivated. I would recommend you to use Remitly or Revolut. Fast and reliable, so far.",

I encountered a problem today and I chatted with 3 world remit agents. It took 1 hour as the agents rudely leave chat when when you try to read their comment and type in your question.  I asked a simple follow upmquestion.and they kept repeating themselves when I already said that part is clear. After over 1 hour of talking to 3 of their help support, they finally understood my question.and ended up saying I can use a different card.  World remit should read the transcripts.  It was horrible and such a waste of time. Did I mention, I'm a long term customer?  Service is becoming worse to worst.If you can avoid using world remit, please don't.",

The scammer tried to make out that this was a refund form but it required me to enter my card details to receive the refund - if this had been a genuine customer service representative, they'd have already had my payment details on file against the transaction. There was also a random account name that had been added to the app as a recipient?!

This should have been done beforehand to avoid delays.When I reached out for help, the live chat agent was extremely unprofessional and unhelpful. The representative (I believe a female agent) was slow to respond, took long to read my messages, and her tone made it clear she wasn’t interested in assisting me. She kept repeating “wait for an email” without offering any real help or reassurance. To make matters worse, she abruptly ended the chat, saying she didn’t want to waste time.This was a stressful situation made worse by a disrespectful support experience. Very disappointed",

Over a week later, the funds have still not been received by the intended recipient. This money was meant for a life-saving medical procedure.I’ve contacted WorldRemit multiple times since their response below to my previous post and even submitted the recipient’s bank statement showing no deposit. On Friday, an agent admitted the transaction was still pending with the local partner and assured me it was being cancelled. I was told to expect confirmation by email — which never came.In a subsequent live chat (screenshots available), a different agent insisted the funds were “delivered” — offering no proof, no date, no response to evidence, and zero accountability. When I asked for clarification, they simply repeated canned responses and brushed me off.This is unacceptable. There has been:•\tNo traceable proof of delivery•\tNo internal consistency or escalation•\tNo meaningful customer support or resolutionIf a transfer fails and your only response is “our system says it’s done,” how is anyone meant to trust your service?I’ve now had to escalate this to my bank, next steps are the Financial Ombudsman, and am considering further legal options.If you value your money — or basic human decency — AVOID WorldRemit at all costs.",

When I checked today, June 7, It still says \"refund processed and it may take up to 3 business days to process.\" With a corresponding date of June 7, 2025. And everyday when I check, it also is up to date accordingly. There is no number to call. And if you call after hours, yes, they are not available.

After answering all the questions and submitting proof I got the following: We have reviewed your account and transaction history, and unfortunately found that it does not meet WorldRemit's approval criteria. That’s because we currently don’t support charitable operations. And so, your account has been permanently disabled, and you’ll no longer be able to use WorldRemit services.Because you help friends and family in need, you are blocked. They also kicked out other friends. What exactly is the problem why people can't send money to Mozambique through you?

All Junlyn ever did was give me her initial reply which was \"problem with the route\" .The other time she closed sent me WorldRemit terms and conditions to inform me that WorldRemit is not \"liable\" ,instead of trying to find out the solution to a technical problem.The problem was finally resolved a by other competent people on 28.05.2025",

However, since last week, I have been encountering repeated problems like this, with my transfers failing multiple times.I previously deleted my reviews because my refund was credited back to my account in less than an hour, and I was able to resend the money. But now, the same issues have occurred again.What’s most disappointing is that it takes 3-7 days to credit the refund back to my account, which is a very long wait. I chose to transact with WorldRemit because of your promise that most transactions would be sent immediately, within minutes, especially since this is an emergency situation. This delay defeats the purpose and causes a lot of stress.I will wait for my refund to be returned to my account and look forward to hearing from you to resolve this ongoing problem.",

Up until about six months ago, it was completely reliable, fees were reasonable, exchange rates were reasonable.For the last six months, though, I have been unable to use Worldremit to send to one of my primary recipients in Kenya.  The transactions cancel within a few minutes - the money is promptly refunded but I have to use another transfer agent.Tech support has been persistently just closing the support tickets without resolving the issue.  They blame M-Pesa or me; M-Pesa blames Worldremit and the issue persists.  Promises to escalate to the \"technical team\" or \"engineering\" never result in any outcome other than yet another ticket closed without resolution and with no evidence of any effort to contact me or actually address the issue.It is a great tool... when it works.  When it doesn't, there doesn't appear to be any path to a resolution.UPDATE:  After my initial review here, Worldremit finally did reach out to me and was able to resolve the issue within 24 hours.  As a result of that, I have updated the rating from 1-star to 3-star.Worldremit has built a global funds transfer infrastructure that is a marvel of design and function and I continue to be in awe of that.  My encouragement to them would be to now consider adopting a customer support escalation process that doesn't require six months of frustration/user blaming and an adverse review on Trustpilot to get them to act.",

The problem is that it is not mentioned anywhere and the user won’t know it unless he cross checks the real rates.I can see in a previous review I can see a reply from you: “WorldRemit’s rates and fees are dependent on many factors and are updated frequently”. That is such a vague answer! If you use the Interbank Exchange rate and yet your rate comes out 2.5% higher, then you are marking it up one way or another.Wise is also claiming to use Interbank exchange rates and their rates actually come out correctly on their website, so please follow their good example and stop hiding the extra fees for your users or at least mention that you will be adding a markup of 2.5% on the currency exchange.

        "text": "This is already the second time I have to leave a negative review here for World Remit. The reason is that the transfers made do not take a few minutes as promised, but instead take days or hours. And beforehand, I was not informed that certain types of transfers could take up to 3 days for the recipient to receive the money. When I then contacted a customer service representative to ask what was causing the delay, I was told to contact Trustly to speed up the process and was brushed off, even though I had questions that needed clarification. I am very, very disappointed with how customers are treated, and I cannot recommend this app to anyone.",

It’s been over a week now, and WorldRemit is still holding my hard-earned money hostage.After several failed attempts to reach someone, I finally got a callback from one of your agents who told me the refund had been processed and I should check with my bank. I did exactly that — and my bank confirmed that no refund has been received.I then called WorldRemit’s contact centre again today, and this time a different agent told me the cancellation was still pending on your end and he had just sent an escalation request to get it sorted. So now I’m getting conflicting stories — and still no money.I don’t know who to believe anymore. Meanwhile, my family is still waiting for the funds, and I’m left chasing WorldRemit for my own money.

I used to recommend family and friends use this service but I myself is at the point of stopping using it at all. Do you guys not know that there are other competitors in the Market now? I am considering paySiin now.Another problem is, they don't have local office and they will never give you their local partner contacts and no one will pick up the number they listed as contact, I have been calling the US number for hours.The only way you can get hold with them is a chat and the agent will say they contact local partner which takes days too",

After hours of trying to navigate their IVR voice recordings, I could never actually speak to a real person. It's like they deliberately make it impossible.I also tried their \"24-hour\" chat support — what a joke. It took 1–2 hours just to get connected to someone, and when I finally did, the agent disappeared halfway through the conversation without helping me. No follow-up, no proper customer service. Just complete silence.So if you are ever in an emergency and your transaction is on hold, the only option you really have is to pray and wait while they hold your money hostage. No urgency, no responsibility.Absolutely terrible experience sending money to India with WorldRemit. Never again.",

World Remit says the money is available for pick up but MLhuillier say their status of the transaction is “pending”. This forces recipients who I’m trying to give financial support to to go home without receiving their money. That’s wasted travel time and money for people who probably do not already have anything. There was once a transaction where it took days for the money to become available for pickup. Whether World Remit or MLhuillier is at fault here, this delay issue needs to get fixed. This service has become unreliable and burdensome to the people we are trying to help. Instead of recipients getting their money, they instead suffer helpless situations at their pick up locations.I do not discount the reliability of this service before when money was actually ready to get picked up once the App tells you the money is ready. I just hope the issue is fixed and that World Remit can be trusted again as a reliable money service.",

This is the first time that my receiving person in Ethiopia didn't get her information from World Remit telling her to pick up her money, and the information she needed for that. Also, the system is getting very specific about which bank she may use, and now she has to go out of her way to get the money, because her local branch can no longer handle the transaction (?) I also am still unhappy with the fact that I can't use my computer, but must use my phone for every transaction, now. It seems that every time I use the service, there is another small inconvenience introduced to make the service a little less dependable or a bit less user friendly for either myself or the person I'm sending money to.",

I contacted WR support, but I was not able to connect, it takes 7 times attempt for me to connect the bot and transferred to agent. The agent(Anne) told me the same thing but when i told her that i contacted the bank and the transfer was successfully done. In the end,She admitted that there is an issue in the system to create the transaction, and have to wait, and if i cant hear the update from them within 24hrs, the amount will be refunded. Such a waste of time and to go through all the hassle but the end of the day issue is not resolve, the purpose of Worldremit its not deliver to your customer. You need to put contact number for your customer to call, i mean a reachable contact number, as the number you provided “not in service”, you cannot rely to the “bot” and online chat support.

I then sent a larger amount from a second account that had a different billing address than my WorldRemit account. That flagged my transaction as fraudulent and my account was disabled. I contacted WorldRemit to rectify the problem and I was told that I would hear back in 24 hours. I heard nothing. I contacted them again and was told I would hear back in another 24 hours. I heard nothing. I contacted them three days later. It was still under review. At which point the operator put me on hold and two minutes later I was told my account was closed. I have nothing good to say about this company. I rarely leave reviews, let alone a bad review and I am always one to give the company the benefit of the doubt. But not this time. To be accused of fraud because I used a debit card with a different billing address than the one on my account is absurd. Do not use this company.",

That was March 11th and so far nothing has been resolved. I’m warning my Somali/Simaliland community around the world not use this company. They had scammed me over 2000$ out of my debt card, don’t be another victim. There are scammers who infiltrated and embedded in their offices. If they really want to investigate a fraud , all they have to do is to go back that phone call I made on February 12 2025.Your phone call disclaimer says: all phone calls are being recorded for quality and training purposes. Listen that phone call and there you have it, one of your agent asking me to provide him my 3 digit security code. That is what you call unsuspecting and naïf customer.

They did not answer nor they acknowledged, so I mailed them one week later. Still no answer.I phoned them two weeks ago, but were hardly able to understand the lady's dialect as she talked very fast. I asked her multiple times to slow down speed of talking, but she didn't so I asked, if we could kindly proceed sending mails. She requested even more personal documents, which I sent.One week after, I asked WorldRemit by mail, how things are proceeding as they still did not answer. On Thursday I mailed them, that I want to get this issue solved until Friday or they kindly close my account, delete all personal documents and acknowledge this to me. They didn't.So now, I have to admit, I am absolutely unsatisfied with their behaviour. My fiancée and me needed a platform so send and receive money. It worked for a long time. Now they suddenly cut that channel down without any reason. I did submit all information they needed. Even more. But they acted in an arrogant way, which is not only not to understand, but also very impolute und not reliable.",

        "text": "Avoid WorldRemit. I have used them many times and they used to be good. Unfortunately their service has deteriorated hugely. My recent experience was farcical. The promised service was not provided and I have spent several weeks trying to get my money back. They have now provided ‘evidence’ that the payment was paid into a different bank from the one I requested. They claim the evidence ‘proves’ the transaction was completed ‘successfully’. Except it actually proves it went to a completely different bank. Of course the money never arrived in the account promised. Customer service has been a succession of calls telling me they have to do more research. No sign they will ever give my money back. Avoid. There are many other more reliable ways to transfer money. NOTE: WorldRemit's response to this review is to urge me to contact WorldRemit. You will know from reading the review that I only wrote this review after weeks of being brushed off by WorldRemit who confirmed for a second time this morning that they unilaterally chose to transfer my money to a completely different bank from the one requested (and paid for) to avoid 'lengthy delays'. They did not tell me they had done that and how is it acceptable to send my money elsewhere without asking me if it's OK to do so (it isn't - I cannot access the funds). So my only edit is to say that the review stands as written with no resolution.",

        "text": "WorldRemit authorized a fraudulent transaction in my account, withdrawing money from my debit card without my authorization to send it to a person in Kenya I did not even know. I tried to contact WorldRemit again to ask for a refund since the fraud happened in their systems and they told me that was my problem and would not refund me. There are better, safer apps to send money abroad so do not use WorldRemit because they do not even care about their customers that are being defrauded.Following up on WorldRemit's answer, I wanted to point out the failure of their systems when it comes to protecting customers from fraud. On January 19, 2025, I received a notification on my cell phone indicating that a transaction was initiated in my account to send the equivalent of $500. Since I neither authorized the transaction nor knew this individual, I promptly contacted WorldRemit’s customer service to block the transaction, as it appeared on my phone that the transaction was still processing. However, their representative informed me that it was too late to stop the transaction, but WorldRemit would promptly reach out to its local representative to block the transfer and notify me to confirm. It’s important to note that accessing the WorldRemit app on my phone requires facial authentication and no one else could have approved the transaction, so the fraud occurred within the WorldRemit systems.After not hearing from them for three days, I re-contacted WorldRemit and was instructed that I had to file an official complaint, which I did, to initiate the process. After filing the complaint and receiving a case number, I managed to speak about my case to a representative in WorldRemit’s fraud compliance operations. He informed me that before this fraudulent transaction, there were a few other failed attempts to send money from my account (most likely initiated by the same individual). When I asked why I was not promptly notified of the previously failed attempts so that I could have secured my account, he had no immediate answers but also mentioned that they were still actively investigating the situation and would get back to me with an update on the status of my case. On February 25, 2025, I received an email from WorldRemit, stating that the money was lost and the case was closed.",

I enquired several times about the business card not working while the 7 times they had charged me $14.99. Eventually, my fees were reprogrammed @ $3.99 but they have never refunded me.Their client support is awful whenever the question require anything more than a very, very easy answer.On March 1, 2025, they advised me they had disabled my account saying that they don't support business or charity operations.

The only way to do that seems to be by phone. But as i already mentioned above, when I call them, they ask for my (old) phone#. And their computer system then says \"we don't recognize this phone #\". And then communication stops, no way to talk to a human being. Maybe they should have read my review twice and they would have understood that. So for now, I recommend Wyse for money transfers. The \"login\" button on that app allows you to log in.",

He had not received the money the following day so he went to his local MPesa office who text him - O Customer, a transaction of Sh56,000.00 with TB46REATDS receipts has been returned automatically as the transaction is outdated. Your current account lag is Tsh133.58.  This clarifies that my friend did not receive the money. I have had 5 frustrating phones with Worldremit with each time being told that the transaction had to be verified and an email would be sent to me within the following 24 hours. Needless to say I have never received an email nor has the money been returned and I find the endless circle of lies so disappointing. The children have now been told not to return to school until the fees are paid  -  what can I do???    I have used Worldremit many times but I will never use them again. Again after yesterdays phone call with a promise someone would ring me back - no one has. What a dreadful service",

Out of nowhere, they changed their internal processes and started demanding ridiculous amounts of documentation, even after my account was fully verified.Now, my account is blocked, and I can’t complete transactions without going through this unnecessary hassle. I have provided what ever I could, and request making things for customer easy and not hard.Their customer service is just as disappointing. Instead of offering real solutions, they kept repeating the same demands without explaining why this was suddenly necessary. It feels like they don’t value loyal customers at all.Changing internal processes should NEVER come at the expense of user experience. Forcing customers to jump through hoops after everything was working fine is just bad business.I wouldn’t recommend WorldRemit to anyone until they fix this mess.

I wasnt informed the remittance was on hold. after 24 hours more documentation was requested instead of all documents beng requested at the same time, took another 24 hours for my response to be looked at while the remittance was still being held. Documentation requested was for a marriage certificate or joint tenancy agreement to prove  my relationship with one of my recipients, the presumption being that the only reason i would remit overseas was if i was married to or tenanting with a recipient. At the very same time i sent all the requested documents i was told the documents i had sent, which had yet to be looked at were no good, my account was suspended and remains inactive despite being a customer for 4 years + and despite providing my source of funds, employment and verified ID of recipients. The support team/customer service is awesome, the compliance team are horrendous, lazy & incompetent and there incompetence & inaction left my recipient incredibly stressed and in the lurch due to not receiving the remittance she needed for medical costs.",

Sending money through the app is incredibly easy and convenient. Their customer service is responsive and they always answer the phone and handle any issues promptly.If you’re sending money to Lebanon, RIA agents there charge a cash handling fee of only 1%, compared to 2% with most other money transfer services.Highly recommend!",

The staff member called Julisa P has a stinking unprofessional attitude problem and even got my cousin's phone number wrong after I told her it and she didn't even bother to repeat the number back to me to ensure that she got it correct. Her whole demeanor was that off a person who does not know how to work as a customer service agent and who has no professionalism serving customers, she is just toxic! Even the energy behind the desk was different and you can blatantly tell that the staff working with her today did not want to engage too much with her. Even talking in her language to another colleague whilst serving me, and her colleagues where looking at me and then looking at her whilst she was taking! Leave your stinky attitude at home dear, because you never know who your serving or who may know your CEO. This is so incorrect. Next time, I will avoid her like the plague even if she is free, I will decline to be served by her again ! Hopefully she will not be there again when I go there!",

A second reply after sending a reminder, stating they would reach out again and it has been now two reminders in different weeks and now there is just silence but my money was withdraw from my account.I have now requested the cancellation and now waiting if they will even reply or not.I have another issue in December last year where a transfer was still pending/processing for weeks.

There were some hiccups that left me frustrated, especially since I’ve relied on Western Union for over 35 years. But to Ria’s credit, their customer service team stepped up. I reached out, and they addressed the issue quickly and professionally.Since then, it’s been smooth sailing—fast transfers, fair rates, and a system that works reliably. I now prefer Ria over Western Union, and I’m glad I gave them a second chance. They turned things around and earned my trust.",

In fact the recipient never received the money. Therefore, I had to contact their Customer Service quite a few times and speak to their Team leader to provide me the proof of payment, as they claimed the money was paid, but they could not provide any proof at all, which made the situation worse. This clearly indicates, they have sent the money to someone who is not my recipient, or they never made the payment to anyone, or they never transferred the money at all. On this circumstances, I've decided to a legal action by making an official complaint via Ombudsman Financial Service, UK for  my money along with a compensation, as it is nearly 7 days, the problem remained same. I will suggest customers to be careful about using their service from now. I am unhappy, unsatisfied with their poor, unprofessional, unethical, substabdard service.",

I then called 4 days later and was transferred through to three different departments to which their reply was “thanks, that seems acceptable. We will get back to you in 30mins with a reply.” I then get an email asking for the same documents which I’ve already sent before. I immediately replied and still did not get a reply a day later.

Payments via PayID often take weeks to process, and my debit card frequently gets blocked by the bank during transactions, adding unnecessary delays.Sending money overseas feels like a gamble—sometimes it takes minutes, other times days or even weeks. Because of this unpredictability, I only use Ria for non-urgent transfers. For time-sensitive transactions, I rely on Western Union instead.If reliability improved, Ria would be a great option, but for now, the slow processing and technical issues make it hard to fully recommend.",

I called and email  customer service several times on the next few days.  They told me the bank is doing a compliance review with no additional information.  On July 17, 2025 they sent me an email asking for information requested by the bank.  It took almost two weeks of inactivity to ask for additional information (clarification on the text I entered on the Reference optional field!).  I provided the requested information a few hours later and as of today, July 18 at 8:30 pm I have no information on when the money is going to be release.

They took a A$1000 forex spread on an $90,000 transfer from Sydney to Hong Kong and took over a week to make this transfer. I had to call and email them to find out why the delay and they then kept saying the information they had received was incorrect. I resent it more than once. not once did they initiate a call to me saying they needed more information.OFX is a second rate outfit - perhaps they are good in Australia(?) but they should not venture into a competitive environment.",

After countless emails, they are still holding my USD with no end in sight. I consider that I will need to contact my state regulators to get my funds returned...They are advising I \"recall\" the funds, but this is not possible because the account I sent the funds from is no longer open as I changed banks...

Tried to call that number, without success and obviously i called the cancellation.Rec'd a phone call 8hrs later (so you can reach me by phone if you want) from a person who \"gave me the possibility out of goodwill to waive the cancellation fee\".

        "text": "During the process I spoke with 4 different customer service representatives. The first 3 I only spoke with once. The last, I had 4 different conversations with. Why 4, because this representative Nonni wanted to make sure that there was complete follow through in the process. In the 2nd phone call she told me that her shift was ending soon, but if she hadn't received the necessary information from another department, she would advise her colleagues and ask them to call me when they had the information. 20 or so minutes after her shift had ended and she should have been on her way, she called me as she saw the information come in. Now that was above and beyond! She obviously understood \"Customer Service\", and wanted to make that me (the customer) got SERVICE. She could simply have returned to work the next day and assumed someone else passed the information on to me. But no. In her own time, she delayed her leaving her work place to make sure that I had the information I was waiting for. Unexpectedly I received another call this morning from her as a follow up to so that I understood the next steps in the process and when the transfer of funds would be completed. This employee should receive an award for outstanding care and diligence in ensuring that a customer gets excellent and thorough service. If we all consider the frustration we go through dealing with inadequate knowledge, understanding of an issue, or even care about the customer when a customer service line is called, then a person like Nonni stands out as one of a kind. Any company would benefit greatly if a Nonni could be found to be employed in their customer service/client associate department. She should be taken on tour as corporate trainer to teach others what Customer Service is all about. She's a winner!!!! I'm grateful for her service in my request.",

        "text": "I was recently looking to transfer funds from my bank in France to my U.S. account and was choosing between XE.com and OFX.com. I initially went with XE, especially since they offered a $30 welcome bonus for first-time users. However, my experience didn't go quite as expected.While setting up the transfer with XE, I discovered that my French bank had a daily transfer limit. I contacted XE via chat to either adjust the transfer amount or allow me to send the full amount in parts. They responded that I could send funds over time and once the full amount was received, they’d initiate the transfer. I wasn’t happy with that approach since I wanted to test the service with a smaller amount first. I asked to cancel and restart with a lower amount instead. To their credit, cancellation was easy, but when I tried to restart a new transfer, I found that my $30 welcome bonus had been revoked.When I contacted support, they claimed the bonus had been “used” in the canceled transaction, which wasn't accurate. That was disappointing and led me to check out OFX.com as an alternative.I’m really glad I did.OFX offered a better exchange rate than XE and even without the $30 bonus, I received more money in my U.S. account. The process was smooth from start to finish. They use the same payment channel (a German bank account) for European transfers as XE does, but the fees and rates were more favorable.One highlight of OFX was the personal touch, they called me after I signed up to offer help and answer questions. The transfer process itself was clear and well-communicated via email at every stage. I initiated the transfer around 10:00 AM Eastern Time, and the funds were cleared in my U.S. account the very next day.I was also able to set up rate alerts, so I’ll get notified when the exchange rate hits my preferred level for future transfers.All in all, I’m very happy with OFX: excellent rates, no hidden fees, responsive customer service, and a user-friendly platform. While I was initially disappointed with the way XE handled things, I ended up getting a better deal and smoother experience with OFX. I’ll definitely continue using their service for future transfers",

All these questions could have been asked PRIOR to funds transmittal, yet they chose not to do so. It is almost blackmail when they hold your money and keep making additional and additional inquiries without doing any research themselves. They use a bank in NYC as a transfer agent, and it took three plus weeks after telling OFX to return our funds until the return was finally made.  My advice to future customers is that if you do choose to do business with these people, before sending them any money let them inquire all they want without holding your money hostage. Personally I would rather pay the extra fees to Wells Fargo to transmit money than to put up with OFX's nonsense and delays.You will notice in their reply they avoided the issue which is to get your money first and ask questions later.  So they hold your funds hostage to what they think their regulations are.  Instead I used Wells Fargo, an institution governed by the same regulations, and did not face any problems (unnecessary questions used to delay and hold your money) or delays.",

What truly sets OFX apart, however, is the caliber of the people behind the platform, particularly Rory and Sara Appleton.Rory’s professionalism and market knowledge gave me full confidence at every stage of the process. He took the time to understand my specific requirements and offered tailored guidance that made a real difference. It never felt like I was being \"processed\"it felt like I was being looked after.Sara Appleton also deserves major credit. She handled my queries with patience and clarity, and her responsiveness was incredible. Together, Rory and Sara made what could have been a stressful process feel streamlined and secure.In an industry where many companies promise reliability but underdeliver, OFX, with Rory and Sara on the team, actually delivers. Highly recommended for anyone who values both sharp financial execution and genuine customer care.",

We promptly provided all the updated details required for reactivation on 29th March.However, as of today, 23rd April, we have yet to receive confirmation of our account being migrated. Despite multiple follow-up attempts via phone and email, we have only received repeated assurances that the process will be completed “next week,” without any tangible progress.Seems like the OFX today is great on marketing the new platform but not so great on the customer service.

Response times are measured in days instead of hours. Calls to support get disconnected on transfer, emails are full of typos and incorrect information.OFX what happened? I preferred you over Wise due to having better support and rates. Now I'm not sure if I can trust you with my money any longer.

My recent experience with this so-called service was nothing short of a farcical ordeal, a masterclass in how to alienate and infuriate a customer with needless complexity and outright inefficiency. Allow me to elucidate.I embarked upon what should have been a trivial transaction: the transfer of a modest sum of $2000 between two accounts, both of which are unequivocally mine, bearing my own name. One might assume such a task would be executed with ease, a mere flick of the wrist in the digital age. Alas, no. OFX, in its infinite ineptitude, transformed this simple act into a labyrinthine nightmare.First, I was subjected to their exhaustive biometric KYC process, a procedure so intrusive it might have been lifted from the pages of a dystopian novel. A real-time voice call followed, as if my digital fingerprints and photographic evidence were insufficient to prove my identity. Having jumped through these hoops, I was granted the illusory \"green light\" to proceed. Foolishly, I believed the worst was behind me.I initiated the transfer, only to be met with a fresh barrage of demands: additional KYC documentation, each request more superfluous than the last. With patience I did not know I possessed, I complied, providing every scrap of evidence they demanded. A week passed—a week!—and still, my funds languished in OFX’s clutches. It was only when I threatened legal action that they deigned to respond, and even then, their demands grew more ludicrous. They insisted on proof that I had sent the money—proof I had already furnished—and subjected me to further delays. Nine days. Nine days to return my own money to me. Such staggering incompetence defies belief.Let us pause to consider an analogy, shall we? Imagine purchasing a $2000 laptop from a store. You submit to a biometric ID process, prove your payment account is legitimate, and pay for the item. Your bank verifies the transaction. Yet, the store refuses to hand over the laptop. Instead, they demand your employment history, salary, payslips, and bank statements to determine if you can \"afford\" the purchase. Then, they take days to decide whether to release the item. Would any rational person tolerate such behavior? Of course not. The store would be shunned, its reputation in tatters. Yet, this is precisely how OFX operates—a Kafkaesque parody of customer service.OFX’s conduct is not merely inefficient; it is insulting. It is the institutional equivalent of treating every customer as though they were a suspect in a criminal investigation. The sheer audacity of their demands, coupled with their glacial pace, is an affront to basic principles of commerce and decency. If you derive pleasure from being treated with suspicion and contempt, then by all means, patronize OFX. For the rest of us, there are simpler, saner alternatives. A direct bank transfer, for instance, accomplishes in hours what OFX cannot manage in days.This debacle is emblematic of why traditional finance (TradFi) is hemorrhaging trust and relevance in the face of decentralized finance (DeFi). Companies like OFX, with their byzantine processes and utter disregard for customer dignity, are the architects of their own obsolescence. They are not merely failing their customers; they are actively driving them away.In conclusion, OFX is a cautionary tale, a case study in how not to conduct business. Save yourself the indignity and avoid this wretched service at all costs.",

You can also check the progress by logging into your OFX account either online or via thier OFX app.The entire process takes 2-3 days as there can be delays of up to 24 hours for banks to send or receive the funds.Seriously, FOREX couldn't be better!",

From the outset, Hayley has been incredibly responsive, always available to assist with any questions or issues that arise. Her expertise and attention to detail have made managing payments a breeze.One of the most impressive aspects has been how quickly payments are processed. The system is straightforward and efficient, ensuring that funds are transferred seamlessly and in a timely manner. The entire process is smooth, and I’ve experienced minimal delays, which is a huge relief when managing multiple transactions.Hayley’s support has been invaluable, and the OFX platform itself is incredibly easy to use, making it a perfect fit for our business needs. I highly recommend working with Hayley and using OFX for anyone looking for reliable, fast, and user-friendly payment solutions.",

I run a small business and every week I’m firing off funds to China to pay for orders, and OFX makes it smoother than a panda sliding down a bamboo chute. My account manager, Eric Trinh, is an absolute legend—always on the ball, quick with replies, and somehow makes currency exchange sound less stressful than it should be. I’d recommend Eric and the OFX team to anyone with foreign currency needs, whether you’re sending cash to Timbuktu or just keeping your overseas suppliers happy.

        "text": "I had great expectations after reading the reviews on OFX. This was my first transfer which I began with transferring British Pounds on Wednesday 12/02/2025 to my bank account in Turkey. Normally I expect the transfer to take between 1 - 2 hours, or as a new customer about 1 day.  Started off with setting up a new account, password and setting up myself as a beneficiary in Turkey.I now begun the transfer with setting up a \"Deal\" (transaction) on 12/02/2025 at 12:21.  I received an email at 12:41 saying my funds had been received.  All well so far.I had numerous emails from OFX to confirm my identity, the location of where the money was to be transferred to, etc.. See below.At 13:38 I received my first email \"Deal Booked - Urgent Action Required\" - They required me to phone them (International phone call) for a \"quick conversation\", which if I did not call them they threatened to cancel the transfer!  This I did.The next day on the 13/02/2025 @ 11:05 I received another email asking me to confirm my current location - apparently requested by their compliance team. - Again I replied and even sent the google map reference as I know the maps in our area of Turkey are a bit vague.  At 14:05 I asked for an update on my transfer and when I could expect to receive it - it's now 24 hours since I began the transfer.  They replied and said they would keep me up to date but could expect the initial transfer to take up to 48 hours. Also that should I wish to adjust my deal I would need to call them.  This is when I first called them and asked them to either complete the transfer that day or cancel the transfer.On the 14/02/2025 @ 10:00 I sent an email why it had now taken 48 hours and still no update as to when I should expect the money.  They responded that I should expect the transfer to take between 1 - 2 days. Sureley that's the same as 48hrs?!Now on 15/02/2025 @ 12:30 they respond with an update - \"I have reached out to our Compliance Team for an urgent update.  As its the weekend we may not have a response until Monday.\"Monday will now be 5 days, a lot longer than the 48 hrs or the 1-2 days as promised.On Sunday, 16/02/2025 @ 12:19 they sent me an email saying \"For security reasons, we need to verbally confirm your transfer over the phone.\"  This I did when the transfer was first set up. Anyway, another international phone call (I'm getting a bit irked by now) and I again reiterate, complete the transfer on Monday or cancel the transfer and return the funds.Now Monday 17/02/2025 @ 15:16 I received the following email \"Our compliance team have completed their review on your account and its now clear to deal.Your funds will be paid out in the next batch today and will clear into the account the same day, sometimes overnight.\"Strangely, no funds!!On the 18/02/2025 @ 02:01 I receive the email \"I can confirm that your account was cleared for us to pay out your TRY funds today, however TRY funds are routed through our bank in the USA, and it is a holiday there today. Your funds should be sent tomorrow, and cleared and available by February 20.\"They even had the gall to send me an email 1 hour later saying \"We want to let you know that funds have now been paid into the recipient account(s) specified.\"  This was sent just after they said I won't get my funds until the 20th February!!Now 8 days after the set up of the transfer and me having sent my money. I still have not received the funds. I have lost 1,800.00 Turkish Lira from then holding onto my transfer rate from 13/02/2025 but only paying out the Turkish Lira 1 week later.  They did not following my instructions on two occasions to cancel the transaction.  So PLEASE BEWARE. How many other customers funds have they held onto for a week, gained interest and and made a killing in exchange rate increases? Some poor customer support staff member has to put up with my frustration as their company rips people off and profits form their so called \"compliance team\". How can compliance take a week, unless you want to draw it out?!Finally, 19/02/2025 @ 12:04 I have received an email from my bank – money received.It has taken OFX 7 days to complete this transaction at a loss of 1,800.00 Turkish Lira which in the past other companies take between 1 to 2 hours, and even on first transfers a maximum of 2 days.",

A recent transaction involving $81k was processed incorrectly, and despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, my funds have been withheld without explanation or action.I was told the transaction was mistakenly initiated and that my funds were being held due to an unresolved issue on their end. The ACH debit was made, but the payment never came through as agreed. To make matters worse, there has been zero communication from their support team, leaving me in the dark with no timeline for resolution.This kind of service is unacceptable. Holding customers' funds without transparency or a clear plan for resolution is unethical. I was informed that the issue should have been handled by my bank, but OFX has failed to take responsibility for correcting the error.To anyone thinking of using OFX, be cautious. They have shown a complete lack of professionalism, and I am now forced to seek legal assistance to get the matter resolved. I strongly recommend you consider other options when transferring large sums of money.",

Despite following all the necessary procedures and providing required documentation, my funds have been withheld without any clear communication or resolution.The transaction was initiated by the company, and while the ACH debit was processed, the payment was never made as promised, and no response has been provided to resolve the issue. After contacting their team multiple times, I’ve received nothing but silence.In my experience, this is unacceptable service, especially when customers' hard-earned money is involved. In fact, the merchant responsible confirmed the withdrawal was a mistake, and they stated that the issue should have been handled by the bank – not by sitting on customer funds without action.To those considering using OFX, please be aware of the risk associated with this company. I am now seeking legal assistance to have the matter resolved.I expect OFX to take immediate responsibility, adhere to federal law on reversing unauthorized ACH debits, and return the funds promptly. If you're having similar issues, I urge you to speak up and hold them accountable.Stay cautious and informed. 👀#OFX #ConsumerRights #ACHDebit #UnresolvedFunds #CustomerService #Finance",

After the transfer was done, I had checked how much has been transferred, and it was only 73 euros. I could not believe that intermediary bank- RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL AG VIENNA took 27 euros out of 100 euros.  The beneficiary bank told me that OFX sent STA code to intermediary bank to let them charge me for the transfer and they really charge me well - 27 euros, OFX should use OUR code to not let intermediary bank to charge customers for the transfer. I sent several emails to OFX and no responses to my email. The customer representative called me and told me that they do not have control how much intermediary bank charge, which is unacceptable , we as customers do not have option to choose intermediary bank  and OFX gives a false impression that their exchange rate is a good rate because end result could be much worse than using other available companies in Australia that are on paper not as good as OFX.

We then tried to contact them to discuss whether they can sync directly with Xero, and whether we could add another user who could set up the foreign exchange payments. Firstly, their team had terrible trouble simply understanding what we were asking and we had to clarify the simple request 5 times. Eventually they stopped responding and went silent. We switched to TorFX who responded immediately and can provide what we were asking for. OFX are not in the same league.Addendum in response to OFX reply. You have responded within 2hrs of us leaving this honest review. We tried for 4 weeks to get an answer before. So please do not patronise us by asking us to contact you to resolve it, we tried that and you failed to respond. Your ship with us has sailed and we are now with TorFX.",

Their instructions led to me making a wire transfer instead of transferring to my CAD bank account.

I'd gone above and beyond their requests even giving the contact details of the Pastor for them to make contact but now they've delayed the payment to him but processed our other payments in preparation for our Wedding abroad and we've now had our plans pushed back. OFX had stipulations they wanted addressed but forget to mention this to me the customer, who's using their service of a money transfer. They did not make their further stipulations known to me for me to meet them and have my money transferred as it should of been. I had to chase OFX down, to then be told they wanted further information before releasing payment, but they've never mentioned this at any stage of my joining up with them.",

        "text": "We’ve used Ofx over the years successfully, but have found our current transfer to be a complete nightmare. We initially called pre transfer and customer service guy took note of the transaction amount, but provided no help or advice of requirements. When transfer was booked no guidance was provided on compliance requirements, and when these arrived they had no relation to the source of funds which the first call advised Ofx of. When we called to clarify the requirements Ofx agreed that their ask (proof of employment) was misplaced as it had no relation to source of funds, but it seems that nothing happened to change their requirements and documentation didn’t go to compliance team until their original requirements were met. 6 days later no funds as it’s sitting with ‘compliance’ with no communication. Will call again today, but this is not the customer service we saw in the past.We are a week plus since funds we’re transferred to Ofx and are stuck with no update and no €€.Updating 25th:- after initial documents were provided 6 days ago Ofx today requested basic ID and address confirmation today, which again could easily have been provided last week. This sits even outside of their own compliance team SLAs of two days.Further update 27th:- No update from Ofx on transfer and on calling again update is ‘it’s with compliance’.  Formal complaint hasn’t illicit a response either, nor has emailing the email address below. Seem like no one is home. We are 9 days now since funds have been transferred and can’t seem to get any answers.AVOID.",

I am forever grateful.I want to especially mention Dendi,  who was the last consultant I spoke with. He was very patient and reassuring that the process was moving forward.

When i asked for the money to be returned, they asked for a screenshot of my money leaving my account, and this after having sent me confirmation that the funds had reached them a week earlier.

Initially, they claimed that the intermediary bank was holding the funds for sanctions checks. Then, on August 28, they informed me that the bank had released the hold and was processing the payment. However, the funds have yet to be received. Despite my continuous follow-ups, they have only provided vague and nonsensical responses, such as stating that the bank is on holiday and we can't provide timeline for resolution. I plan to file a complaint with the authorities.*Update: as of today 4 September, OFX has returned the funds to my OFX account and now processing a new deal of transfer.

We were getting all payments in our account as soon as I tried to make a transfer our account showing a verification requirement.This error came after the account was active for almost a month and after we have received around 15 payments from Stripe. We run a very simple eCommerce business.When I clicked to complete the verification, it showed nothing and all it did was refreshed the page. I contacted our account manager and asked her what's going on. She said will work with internal team to get this fixed.She got back to me and said I need to provide address verification proof. This was so strange since we already did the address verification before the account was approved. After a lot of back and forth the address verification was approved and then she told me now the team wants to see if we have any agreement with the company we are paying.We hired a marketing company for our ecommerce brand and showed them the contract. Told her if they have any issues they can just cancel the transfer.She told us that the team is reviewing the agreement and will update soon. I keep following her on this issue and still there is no update.She keep saying team is working on this and even she is frustrated now.It has been OVER A MONTH NOW AND NO UPDATE!!She told me she even contact the Vice President and they keep telling her we are working.All our funds are stuck and team won't respond.WHY WOULD YOU APPROVE ACCOUNT AND THEN HOLD MONEY!!!BEWARE AND DON\"T TRUST!!",

The process involved seven or eight different emails, each from a different person, which is understandable given the nature of your service, but I didn't feel I was being dealt with personally and that the people were not always connecting the emails.  Only after OFX received the money, was I asked for \"supporting information,\" after which I heard nothing for several days  When I finally asked how much longer I had to wait, I received an telephone call from the \"Middle Office\" in which the lady said my application had been rejected, and that I should send verification that I had paid the amount (which I had already sent earlier as part of the supporting information, but had to send again because of the lack of communication in the firm). I was never given an acceptable reason for the rejection, and the whole procedure was impersonal and robot-like.Dr. Barron Holland",

        "text": "Initial verification asked for my passport.   Okay, a passport is a good method to verify.   Employers use this since the US government has already verified identity and vetted prior to getting a passport.Then a video.   Okay, I can see this to make sure I actually am the person in the passport photo.Next they ask for the SSAN.   TOTAL B*LLSH*T!!!!!  I have to provide my SSAN to get a passport, so I'm already verified.  OFX DOES NOT NEED THAT to make a transfer.I will be providing my bank account information for doing a transfer.So, you want my passport, my bank account information and my ssan.   Every piece of information an identity thief would need!  My ID (passport), my address (from the passport), my bank account information and my ssan.  Identity thief's dream!  Whether you intend anything nefarious or not, if you are ever hacked, then I'm screwed.As someone else said, prepare for a colonoscopy.  You can claim it's for security, but for transferring money, you do not need the SSAN to verify me.  The passport process has ALREADY done that.There's security and then there's idiocy.   OFX crosses the idiocy line.Edit:   In their reply, they say they must have this because it's a highly regulated industry/business and to \"facilitate\" transfers.   Nice try, but other companies can make a transfer without subjecting people to PII abuse.  But, not OFX.  To transfer money, the banking information of the sender and the banking information of the receiver is needed to \"facilitate\" a transfer.",

I needed additional security clearance for my latest transaction. My ID details were required. I submitted them 5 times, with nobody being able to tell me what was wrong until the last submission - and it was never acknowledged in writing.My emergency passport (expiring at the end of this year) that I am able to use to travel to and from the USA was not acceptable to pay for my children's tuition fees in Australia. This is unacceptable. It was unnecessary. I will not be using OFX again. If I could have rated this with no stars, I would have, as nothing is what I was able to accomplish with OFX.",

The whole journey was so easy, fast and very impressive. This is a company delivering world class service. Thank you. Chris",

        "text": "I sent money from Canada to USA to my brother due to emergency. As they claimed to send it within 3 business days I ended up choosing ofx. Unfortunately my brother didn't receive the money past a week. So I called them to inform the issue. I am an international student in Canada and my brother is also an international student. Spending 265$ is not easy for us. We work hard to earn it. Anyways, I called ofx customer service and they said the money is yet to be transferred which really made me anxious. So after talking to them I decided to cancel my transaction cause I already send the money via Remitly which is way more effective. They promised me to send my money back by the next day. It has been 1 month and I haven't received my money. I called and they as usual apologize and say that they will return it to me in 1 business day. They even take 15$ exchange fee for the transfer, which isn’t informed earlier. I believe this ofx thing is a scam.",

They also have terrible internal processes, my Direct Debits often don't get triggered resulting in my clients getting very upset and me having to chase things up.

In my case the amount isn’t too big as compared others here. It’s just $1500 and I was transferring it between my bank accounts. OFX came up with a novel pretext of asking fathers name and they won’t transfer or return the money unless I divulge more personal details. Other money transfer companies don’t ask for such details. Don’t trust this company with any of your private information or money. You’ll lose both. How was my account approved by OFX? Why the transfer accepted in the first place ? How is this company still in business ? Why don’t the authorities shut it down ? What a scam. Although only a week has passed (since 15 May 2024) but going by the other reviews I won’t be seeing $1500 returned anytime soon. Request everyone here to also file complaints with their in country regulators.",

There was no escalation process nor a way to lodge a formal complaint. Now they are holding my money and I cannot get it back. Beware before sending money to the company. You may save a little in the short term but if there is anything that goes wrong, good luck getting your money back.Edit: two months have passed since OFX replied to my review and the issue has not been resolved and they are still holding my money.

Urgent action required we cant send YOUR MONEY because we want to know more information about youMy bank to bank transfer as I would normally use transferred the funds in under 6 hours ..I relied on a recommendation to use OFX, I won't be recommending them.OFX tried to block my review.....Next time you dont like something OFX web moderators, how about fix the business, stop using fine print to circumvent privacy Act regulations which you clearly have and try to hide behind anti money laundering requirements... its an overreach too many businesses in the financial sector use these daysAs a positive once I asked for my funds to be returned and providing proof that I'd paid those funds, even though your system acknowledged that funds had been received, they were returned in full, not one cent missing the next dayNot convinced, search for low ratings of OFX, I am not alone and who knows how many they have successfully blocked because OFX didnt like it...Thank you Trustpilot for keeping customers experiences transparent",

No one told me that my transfer was dependent on this.  Had the form required about a month ago been correctly formulated, all would have been ok but I guess the progammers did not get that other countries have a different amount of numbers so my form was constantly rejected.  However, I sent the bank statement five days ago and still zero.  Worse, I have been holding on the phone for 1.5 hours and no one responds.

After the three weeks on having my account approved. I started using it finally, sent 6 payments to my employees, first, it said 1-2 business day but at this point, it’s been about 5 business days and my employees still haven’t received the payment. I tried calling their support and they all say the same thing(it’s still processing)Some other points to note:-- My account randomly stopped working in the middle of doing payroll after sending the salary to half of my employees- Their exchange rate is probably the worst I’ve seen in the undustry.",

I had a very blunt email back stating my account has been closed, but I'm still getting voicemails left by this company. I have blocked their email & number since.

This transaction was held up by xe.com and they asked me a number of intrusive questions about the relationship with my friend and also wanted an invoice in my name from her in a pdf format! All for €90! Ridiculous! In the end I transferred the money to her by PayPal and closed my account with xe.com. When I discussed this with with xe.com they gave the usual blather about legalities and even mentioned the Bribery Act! Xe.com legal and compliance team needs to show some common sense, otherwise they will continue to lose customers like me.",

So having confidence in XE I kept using it for my transfers until the last transfer. I performed my last transfer last Friday.On Monday got an email stating that I need to call the customer service because they could not contact me on my mobile phone. I rang them on Monday to answer some security questions. The operator stated that the answers would be reviewed by the security team. Rang them again on Wednesday still waiting for the transfer to be completed. At the time of writing this, it is already Thursday. I am not sure whether to trust the company any more, having thoughts that it might be is some sort of financial strive - hope not.

I had read the bad reviews on TrustPilot so I tested it with a small transfer. I became skeptical when immediately after creating an account someone called me and offered me a better exchange rate. The site was not very easy to navigate but I managed to put in a small transfer request. I made the request on July 17. On July 18 the money was taken from my account. From July 17-22 the status said \"Action Required\" with no clue as to the action required or who should take action. On July 22 I got an email that said the transfer was complete, but the money did not appear in my bank until July 23. When I use Wise, the transfer completes immediately without issue; they give you the spot price with no spread and just charge a fee.",

However as I was now using Xe for GBP to EUR I decided to check their rates on EUR to GBP. Lucky I did as Xe rate was considerably more favourable than the other company. On small transfers (less than £5000?) the difference may not be so noticable however on 'property sale' amounts (in hundreds of thousands) it is very well worth comparing rates and I can highly recommend Xe for simplicity, speed and ease of transfers in either direction.",

Instead of double-checking with me and send a request reply, XE initiated the return of the funds without further asking and putting me in a very dire position in relation to the beneficiary.

        "text": "I initiated a transaction on 24th June, and the payout page stated the transfer would typically be completed in a few minutes. However, I was later informed that it could actually take 1 to 3 business days.After waiting the full 3 business days, I contacted support for an update and was asked to provide additional information, which I promptly submitted. I was then told to wait another 1 to 3 business days for processing.On the following Monday, I was again asked for more details. When I sought clarification on what exactly was required (as the instructions were unclear), I was told that XE had contacted their partner and I should wait for a response via email. At that point, I realized this could easily take another 1 to 4 business days, so I decided to request a refund on 7th July.I was told they had initiated a callback to the recipient bank (some partner bank actually) and were waiting for a response, with a follow-up date set for 14th July. On 14th July, I was simply informed that they still hadn't received a response and were waiting again — this time until 21st July for the next follow-up (extremely disappointed). It seems clearly delaying tactics, holding payment for so long period!IMPORTANT:The money never reached the recipient bank. It is currently held by XE's partner bank.I was given three different reference IDs, and the recipient bank confirmed that none of them match any transaction in their system.This situation is both frustrating and unacceptable. I understand that international transfers may occasionally take time, but1. Being constantly misled on timelines2. Having to wait 7 days between every follow-up, as it is a stoneage era :)As of now, my funds are stuck with their partner bank, and XE has provided no concrete resolution. I am planning to consult with a lawyer this Thursday to explore options for recovering my money and seeking compensation for the misguidance, miscommunication, and emotional distress caused by this ordeal.I will never use XE again and strongly advise others to stay away from their services.DO NOT USE XE. I repeat, DO NOT USE XE.",

International transfers cost a fortune and I would have needed to make one in order to use XE. For a so-called international money transfer service this is a joke.

They have great conversion rates from these currencies to all others in the world.They only hold these 3 accounts, so you can't transfer in other currencies. So yes, they state to have the best currency rates, but no, they can not give them. I'm a UAE account holder and they can't receive AEDs, so be aware of the transparency.",
